This is an electronic version of the book "The Electron-Positron Lattice Space" by Menahem Simhony.

A PDF version of this book is [publically available here](https://www.epola.co.uk/Simhony/PaperBack_dnld.htm).
The quality of this PDF version is not so great however, that's the reason this digital version was made.

In general, the content was not changed, with the following exceptions:
* some spelling and punctuation changes (where the mistakes were spotted)
* the images were vectorized for better quality

There might be some typos introduced in the book, because of copying the text from the PDF. If you spot any changes, please open an issue and / or a pull request in this repository. If you are new to git and / or github, check out [the documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) for an introduction.
