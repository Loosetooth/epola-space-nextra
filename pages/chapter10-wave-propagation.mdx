# Chapter 10. Epola Wave Propagation and Interaction with Matter

</div>


### 10.1 Absorption and dissipation of epola waves by random vibrations

The physical conditions under which vibrations of epola particles form an
epola wave motion were discussed in Section 7.1. We shall now discuss the
physical processes which an established epola wave or its representative &ndash; the
electromagnetic wave &ndash; undergoes while propagating in the epola. The
inevitably present factor disturbing all epola wave motions are the random
vibrations of epola particles around their lattice sites (Section 5.11).

In our formulation of the Huygens principle (Section 7.1), we explained that
when an epola particle is reached by an epola wave, it is forced to vibrate with
the frequency of the wave; therefore. the particle becomes the center of a new
spherical epola wave. Suppose that an epola wave-front reaches a certain lattice
site. However, the epola particle is not there but, due to the random vibrations,
it is momentarily further out. Then it is reached by the wave-front at a
slightly later moment. If the particle is in front of its lattice site, then it is
reached by the wave slightly earlier. In both cases, the energy transferred to the
particle by the wave is less than the amplitudinal value in the wave. Hence, the
continuation of the wave, initiated by the particle, will have less energy. Such
events at large result in *absorption*, which transfers some wave energy into the
energy of random vibrations of epola particles.

We see that epola particles, which are momentarily further out of their
lattice sites, receive the wave signal slightly later than the particles in their lattice
sites. Particles in front of their lattice sites receive the wave signals slightly
earlier than particles which are in their lattice sites. The delays and advances
have the local effects of reducing and increasing frequency. These opposed
effects do not cancel out completely. The general trend to reduce energies
involved in physical processes leads here to some net reduction in frequency,
thus to *non-linear absorption*. The simplest example of non-linear absorption is
the reduction in vibrational frequency of a pendulum in such energy-absorbing
media as compressed air, water, oil, or honey.

Yet another process is the *deflection* of the wave. The basic physical
interaction here occurs when the wave-front reaches a lattice site whose particle
is out to the right or left. In such case, there is no delay in energy transfer but a
change in the shape of the wave-front, initiated by the deflected particle. This
also means a change in the direction of the ray, which is perpendicular (normal)
to the wave-front. In bulk, such processes lead to the dissipation of the wave
motion.


### 10.2 Fading of long-wave electromagnetic radiation due to epola random vibrations

The linear and nonlinear absorption and the dissipation of epola wave
energy due to the interaction with epola random vibrations, discussed in Section
10.1, affects, in principle, all spectral ranges and all frequencies. However, the
effect is significant only in low-frequency electromagnetic radiation. The lower
the frequency of the wave, the larger is the radius of the half-wave deformation
cluster, and the number of randomly vibrating epola particles in the cluster is
larger. A larger number of randomly vibrating particles results in a stronger
absorbing and diverting action.

The nonlinear absorption in the long-wave electromagnetic radiation
reduces the frequency of the wave and increases the wavelength, increasing the
number of absorbing particles in the half-wave deformation cluster. This results
in an increased non-linear absorption and further frequency reduction, and so
on, until a zero frequency or infinite wavelength, i.e., until the epola wave
motion fades away completely. Then all the energy of the epola wave (the
electromagnetic radiation) is turned into the energy of random vibrations of
epola particles.

The fading out of low-frequency epola waves can best be observed on the 60
Hz electromagnetic waves radiated by the wires of our alternating current
power-lines. In the immediate vicinity of such a line, even a pocket transistor
radio (battery-operated) detects the radiation and sounds the characteristic
hum. Moving away with an appropriate receiver, one obtains a lower signal and
may distinguish a lower pitch. The distance at which the signal fades away
completely depends also on the sensitivity of the receiver.

A precise measurement of the dependence of the amplitude and frequency
of the 60 Hz radiation on the distance from the radiating wire (or sheet) might
yield the experimental evidence for the absorption by epola random vibrations.
For this, we should eliminate as much as possible the air, which could also be
suspected as an absorber of the 60 Hz radiation. Therefore, the experiments
should be carried out in the best achievable vacuum and/or cleanest deionized
air.

Non-linear absorption, with wavelength-increase as function of the distance
to the receiver, is observed in long-wave (3 km) radio-communication on
distances of a thousand km. On such distances, the absorption may mostly occur
in masses of wet air and it is hard to say what part of it is due to epola random
vibrations.


### 10.3 Distances between particles in atomic bodies

Solid and liquid atomic bodies consist of host atoms, forming the molecules
of the body, impurity atoms (dopants), "free"**\*** electrons and/or free "holes"**\*\***.
They also contain various kinds of structural defects: vacancies, grain and twin
boundaries and surface layers, which differ from the bulk of the body in
structure and sometimes also in chemical composition. The sizes of the atoms
are ~100 pm and the distances between the nuclei of neighboring atoms are
~300 pm. In gases at normal conditions, the molecules arc ~10 times farther
apart. Inside the atoms, the distances between the orbital electrons and their
remoteness from the nucleus depend on their number. With 20 orbital electrons
(as in $\mathrm{Ca}$), the average distance between them is ~25 pm. This distance is
proportionally smaller in heavier atoms.

<Callout type='info'>
**\*** The quote indicates that, unlike free electrons in the vacuum (epola) space, these electrons are
'free' only *inside* the atomic body.
</Callout>

<Callout type='info'>
**\*\*** A hole is a spot in the atomic body (solid or liquid) where an electron is missing, which had a
negative effective mass (Section 8.12). The spot or hole acts therefore inside the body as a particle,
having a positive charge $+e$ and a positive effective mass. (Compare with Dirac's hole in Section 4.1.)
</Callout>

The distances between the orbital electrons inside the atoms are smaller than
the distances between any other particles of the atomic body. But even these
distances are thousands of times larger than the distance between epola
electrons and positrons. The epola lattice constant is $l_0 = 4.4 \ \mathrm{fm}$, so that in the
volume of an atom, there are $10^{13}$ epola unit cubes of volume ${l_0}^3$, or $10^{13}$ epola
particles, and in a cubic cm, there are $10^{37}$ epola particles, and only $10^{23}$ atoms of
the atomic body, i.e., $10^{14}$ epola particles for each atom. Therefore, in the epola
space, atomic bodies appear as highly diluted and weakly bound conglomerates
of nuclei and electrons, thousands and up to hundred thousand of epola units
apart from each other.


### 10.4 Electrons and holes in metals, semiconductors and insulators

Atoms of metals easily release their valence electrons, which can move quite
freely inside the metal. In active metals, the concentration of these 'free'
electrons may reach $10^{23}$ per $\mathrm{cm^3}$, meaning that almost every atom has released a
valence electron. Therefore, the metal consists of positive ions of the host atoms
and of a 'gas' of 'free' electrons or the "electron gas". The average distance
between the electrons in the electron gas is therefore similar to the distance
between the nuclei of the ions, i.e., ~500 pm. In less active metals, the density
of the electron gas can be $10^{21} / \mathrm{cm^3}$, so that the mean distance between electrons
is increased to ~1 nm. The high density of free electrons in metals results in the
high electrical conductivity of metals. In some less active metals, especially in
"semimetals", electric currents can also be carried by free holes.

The ionization energy of a host atom in a semiconductor is much higher than
in metals. However, atoms of various dopants are easily ionized in the
semiconductor. Therefore, in most of the semiconductors, the "free" electrons
and holes originate mostly from the impurity atoms or dopants, and from
structural defects in the material. In n-type semiconductors, the electrical
conduction is due to "free" electrons, and in p-type semiconductors, it is due to
free holes. The concentrations of these charge-carriers vary in semiconductors
from above $10^{18} / \mathrm{cm^3}$ down to $10^{12} / \mathrm{cm^3}$. Accordingly, the average distance
between the charge carriers is 10 nm to 1 $\mathrm{\mu}$m. These concentrations can increase
in semiconductors by orders of magnitude, due to heat, pressure, irradiation,
application of electric fields, and other external factors. This is what makes
semiconductor materials so important in modern technologies.

In insulators, the ionization energy of host atoms is higher than in
semiconductors. In addition, impurity atoms do not reduce their ionization
energy in the host-atom matrix of the insulator as drastically as they do in the
semiconductor matrix. Therefore, the concentration of free electrons and holes
is lower than $10^{12} / \mathrm{cm^3}$ and the mean distance between charge carriers is larger
than 1 $\mathrm{\mu}$m.


### 10.5 Interaction of electromagnetic radiation with the free electron gas

The interaction between electromagnetic radiation and the free electron gas
depends on the diameter of the half-wave deformation cluster of the epola wave,
represented by the radiation, and on the average distance between the electrons
in the electron gas. It then seems obvious that epola waves with half-wave
cluster diameters shorter than this distance should be able to penetrate through
the electron gas and interact with the atoms or ions of the body. Hence, the
electron gas in metals should be penetrable for radiation of wavelengths shorter
than 1 nm, i.e., to X-rays of energies above 1.24 keV. In semiconductors, the
electron gas should become penetrable to wavelengths shorter than 1 $\mathrm{\mu}$m.
However, beeause of the much lower concentration of the electron gas, longer
wavelengths are also able to diffract into the bulk of the semiconductor, and are
not eliminated, as in metals. In insulators, the concentration of 'free' electrons is
small; they make small contributions to the reflectivity and absorption and their
role is not significant. Hence, radiation of all wavelengths penetrates into the
insulators and interacts with their atoms.

The reflectivity of metals in all spectral ranges up to X-rays is the highest
among known materials and is almost entirely due to the electron gas in them.
This can be ascribed to the experimentally-known strong correlation between
electrons and electromagnetic radiation. It can easily be explained, because in
the epola model, electromagnetic radiation is due to vibrating electrons and
positrons, and the transfer of energy and momentum is most complete between
particles of equal mass. Therefore, "free" electrons, reached by the vibrations
of particles in the surrounding epola, are swept into these vibrations unconditionally.
This occurs, whether the vibration energy is allowed to the electron
or forbidden. The difference is only in the time delay before re-emission.

A forbidden energy would bring the electron into an energy-state identical
with the state of another electron in the dense electron gas of the metal. The
accompanying waves of the two electrons would then have to unite, being
carried by the same epola particles. This means that the two electrons would
become exposed to a part of their Coulombic repulsion, not balanced by the
attraction to the positive ions of the metal. The exposure would last for a longer
time than in the occasional crossing of paths of two electrons in the electron gas.
Therefore, the outcropped Coulomb repulsion between two
electrons in one accompanying wave causes the rejection or re-emission of the
forbidden energy. This is expressed in the Pauli exclusion principle (Sections
9.3, 9.4).

If the radiation energy is allowed, the 'free' electron keeps and cherishes it,
together with the harem of other vibrations in which it participates. The electron
transfers and re-emits this energy, accepting new portions of it and
losing old ones. As an example may serve the re-emission of the radio and TV
waves, received by our metallic aerials. (Because of this re-emission, our
neighbors may find out what we are watching or listening to). If the energy is not
allowed, then the electron gets rid of it in a very short, practically immeasurable
time. Therefore, it looks to the outside world as if the electron did not commit
the act of accepting the forbidden energy but reflected it immediately, as
demanded by the Pauli principle.

Serious absorption of radiation energy by the electron gas in metals starts at
energies just above the 'work function' values, which vary from 1.9 eV in cesium
to 5.4 eV in platinum. Absorption of these energies results in the photoelectric
effect (Section 3.2). In semiconductors, there is no proximity between the
electrons of the electron gas, which would require the application of the Pauli
exclusion principle, and the electron gas may absorb any amounts of energy, up
to the energies for which it becomes transparent. Therefore, the reflectivity of
the electron gas is smaller than in metals, and also its spectral range is narrower,
ending in the near infrared.


### 10.6 Direct and secondary transparency of atomic bodies to epola waves

The epola model allows us to formulate a general rule for the transparency of
atomic bodies to electromagnetic radiation. From the epola viewpoint, it is
obvious that:

> an atomic body is directly transparent to electromagnetic waves, in which
the diameter of the half-wave epola deformation clusters is smaller than
the distance in the body between such particles or complexes, which resist
the passage of the wave.

This rule fits the transparency of the electron gas in metals but is too restrictive
in the case of the electron gas in semiconductors. We should therefore add that:

> if the concentration of the resisting particles or complexes in the volume of
the body is low, then, due to possible diffraction.,correspondingly longer
wavelengths may be allowed to pass.

The rule does not consider the inevitable thermal absorption by all particles and
complexes of the atomic body, to which all wave-motions are subject. This
absorption reduces the transparency of the body, and sufficiently thick bodies
may turn opaque. This absorption may also lead to some frequency reduction
(Section 10.2).

According to our rule, electromagnetic radiation of wavelength longer than
the distance in the body between atoms and complexes which resist its passage is
absorbed by these constituents of the body. This absorption may cause some
long-term changes in the body, e.g., due to photochemical reactions, or by
creating defects, i.e., by removing atoms or ions from their sites, etc. The
short-term changes can be photoconductivity and/or photovoltaic effects.
However, absorption occurring in atoms may temporarily raise the atoms into
higher energy states. Thereafter, the atoms return to their previous states and
the radiation is re-emitted. As a final result, the body is transparent to the
radiation. This "secondary" transparency does not contradict our rule, because
the atoms which absorbed and re-emitted the radiation did not actually resist its
passage; they only delayed it. Anyhow, because of this delay, we should
distinguish between the secondary transparency and the direct transparency,
which occurs without delay.


### 10.7 Velocity of light in atomic matter

The known values of the velocities of X-rays and gamma-rays in atomic
matter are very close to the vacuum light velocity $c$. However, the velocities of
visible light in atomic bodies are much smaller than $c$: by 25 percent in water, by
34 percent in glass and by 60 percent in diamond. This discrepancy can be
explained by the epola model, on the basis of our transparency rule and the
discussion of Section 10.6. X-rays, the half-wave deformation clusters of which are
not smaller than the distance between orbital electrons in heavy atoms, may still
be absorbed and re-emitted by electrons on the inner-shell orbits of the heavy
atoms. Otherwise, the short X-rays and gamma-rays pass in the bodies directly.
without delay, hence, with a velocity close to $c$. However, visible radiation is
strongly absorbed by the orbital electrons of atoms and then re-emitted by them.
The passage of this radiation is delayed and the resulting propagation-velocity of
this radiation is reduced. Our conclusion is that:

> the primary or direct propagation velocity of electromagnetic radiation in
atomic matter is close to the vacuum light velocity $c$; the observed lower
velocities of certain spectral radiation ranges in some atomic bodies result
from delays caused by the absorption and re-emission of this radiation,
mostly by the atoms of the bodies.

Our explanation fits also the density relations between the epola and atomic
matter. The mass-density of the epola is $10^{10} \ \mathrm{g/cm^3}$. The density of water is $10^{-10}$ that
of the epola density. "Filling" 1 $\mathrm{cm^3}$ of the epola with water means increasing
the density by a $10^{-10}$ part. The velocity of bulk deformation waves is inversely
proportional to the square root of the density (Section 6.3). Hence, the velocity
in water should decrease by a $10^{-5}$ part or by a thousandth of a percent. A
further decrease should be due to the distortions introduced in the epola by the
electrons and nuclei of the water molecules, which were squeezed in between
the epola particles. Some reduction in velocity may also be due to absorption
processes. Altogether, we might expect a velocity reduction of much less
than one percent. The velocity reduction of X- and gamma-rays is of this order.
The observed 25 Percent reduction of the speed of visible light in water could
only be due to the discussed absorption &ndash; re-emission delays.


### 10.8 Reduction of light-velocity in distorted epola

In the previous section, we mentioned a possible reduction in light velocity,
due to the distortion of the epala by the nuclei and electrons of atoms.
Obviously, this reduction cannot be measured inside atomic bodies, not only
because it is small but because the separation of velocity reductions by their
causes is not feasible in atomic bodies. However, we may expect that these
disturbances should exist per se in epola layers immediately adjacent to the
surface of the bodies. We may also approximate the thickness of such distorted
layers to be a billion of epola lattice units, i.e., a few micrometers.

We therefore suggest a measurement of the velocity of light in a laser beam
with the smallest possible cross-section diameter. Thereafter, we would place on
both sides of the beam long blocks of the heaviest possible material (platinum
desired, but may settle for lead), precisely machined, so that they can form a
channel several micrometers wide and measure the velocity of light in it.
The measurement could also be performed with the light-beam in an optical
fiber.

The proposed measurement may have some cosmological aspects. We
mentioned in Section 2.9 that in his 1911 paper, Einstein allowed some change
of light-velocity in a gravitationally distorted space, while in 1916, he denied the
possibility of such change. Hence, the gravitational redshift was ascribed to
frequency reduction only. The distortion of the epola in the narrow channel
between the large masses in our proposed experiment is far in value from the
gravitational distortion in the vicinity of the Sun but would have the same
character, i.e., distortion due to, but outside of, large masses, away from
the interaction of their atoms with radiation.


### 10.9 Interaction of electromagnetic radiation with atomic bodies moving in the Epola

Before analyzing the interaction, we must recall two experimental facts
which contradict our natural perception of matter and space, and which we
therefore instinctively resist and disregard in our thinking. First is the fact,
discovered by Rutherford in 1911, that only a $10^{-15}$ part of the volumes of
atomic bodies (including ourselves) is occupied by dense particles. The rest, i.e.,
practically all the volume, is as empty as the vacuum space and penetrable to
dense particles. The second fact, discovered by Anderson in 1932, is that from
every point of the vacuum space, free electrons and positrons can be released by
submitting 1.02 MeV of energy. Out of this fact, it follows that the vacuum space
must be densely populated by bound electrons and positrons, 4.4 fm apart from
one another (Chapter 4).

Due to our natural perceptions, we always think of the interaction between a
moving body and electromagnetic radiation as of the action of a moving wall,
pushing or pulling the radiation, together with whatever it is in: the space, the
ether or the electromagnetic field. Hence, the moving body increases or
reduces the frequency of the radiation, if not its velocity. It surely is hard to
accept, that in the distance belween every two atoms of the body, there are a
hundred thousand bound electrons and positrons, the vibrations of which are
represented by the radiation. The moving body is just as able to push or pull
these bound particles, as a net with square-kilometer-large eyelets can catch
sardines.

From the epola point of view, the atomic body is a conglomerate of nuclei
and electrons, thousands up to hundred thousand epola lattice units apart, with a
billion times smaller mass density, bound to each other hundreds up to hundred
thousand times weaker than the epola particles. When the body moves, the
interaction of its dense particles with the epola causes epola waves with de
Broglie wavelengths, which accompany the motion of each particle, and forces
the adjustment of the electron orbits to the motion.

The value $c$ of the velocity of epola waves results from a binding energy
which is $10^5$ times stronger than in atomic bodies and from a mass-density which
is a billion times larger. Hence, it would take bodies of nuclear matter to change
$c$. Bodies of atomic matler cannot change this velocity, neither in their bulks
nor in adjacent outsides, except perhaps by a small fraction of a percent. In the
epola, the electromagnetic radiation always propagates with the same velocity,
independent of whether there are moving atomic bodies in it. Inside the moving
or resting atomic body, the quadrillions of epola electrons and positrons, which
participate in the electromagnetic wave, propagate the wave motion with the
same velocity, until their wave-energy is absorbed.


### 10.10 Electromagnetic radiation received by a moving body

Let us consider an atomic body moving with a velocity $v$ relative to the epola,
in which electromagnetic waves are propagating. The body is much larger than
the half-wave deformation cluster of the waves, so that the radiation does not
diffract around it. The body is therefore a receiver of the radiation and can
serve, with proper auxiliary equipment, as a detector of this radiation. To be
specific, let the radiation be in the visible range and the receiver be of any
movable size, from a rocket to a few micrometer-thin foil of a square millimeter
area.

When the radiation reaches the surface of the moving receiver, it continues
to propagate inside with the same velocity $c$, forcing the quadrillions of epola
electrons and positrons inside the foil to vibrate with the same frequency $f$, as it
was outside. Simultaneously, the 'free' electrons of the receiver, the orbital
electrons of its atoms and even the nuclei are shaken with the same frequency $f$.
If none of this shaking is accepted, then the radiation behind the body continues
to propagate with the same frequency and velocity. If all is accepted and
absorbed in the body, whether in the whole thickness or in a certain frontal part
of the thickness, then there is no radiation behind the receiver or inside it,
behind the absorbing frontal part.

Let us now consider the frequency of the radiation, received by the moving
body. During one second, the receiver is approached in the epola by $f$ waves or
$2f$ half-wave deformation clusters. If the receiver moves toward the radiation,
then it 'swallows' more half-wave clusters, and its 'free' and orbital electrons
endure more shakes. If the receiver moves away from the radiation, then during
one second, it receives as many fewer waves as it left behind itself, on the distance
which it passed in one second.

We may say that if wave propagation with velocity $c$ delivers in one second a
number $f$ of waves, then propagation with velocity $v$ of the same frequency
would deliver a number of waves as many times smaller than $f$, as $v$ is smaller
than $c$; hence, a number $fv/c$. Therefore, the number of waves received in one
second by the body moving towards the radiation is $f + fv/c$, while the body
moving away from the radiation receives in one second $f - fv/c$ waves. But these
numbers are the frequencies $f$ of the radiation received by the moving body,
thus:

$$
f' = f\left(1 \pm \frac{v}{c}\right)
$$

or, replacing $f' - f = \Delta f$, we have

$$
\frac{\Delta f}{f} = \pm \frac{v}{c}
$$

These are the equations for the Doppler effect. We recall that the velocity $v$ is
'automatically' much smaller than $c$, because atomic bodies would disintegrate
at $v \ge 0.01 \, c$. We also do not have to worry about it, because the highest velocity
achieved, that of the Voyager, was 52,000 km/h or less than 15 km/s relative to
Earth. This could mean a maximum of, maybe, 45 km/s relative to the epola.


### 10.11 Electromagnetic radiation emitted by a moving body and the Doppler effect

We shall now consider an atomic body, which emits electromagnetic
radiation while moving with a velocity $v$ relative to the epola. Let the emitter be
close to a point-source, e.g., a high-pressure electric arc, a few mm in size,
emitting equally intense radiation in almost all directions. The radiation is due
to thermally-excited atoms, the orbital electrons of which transit to lower energy
states, forcing epola electrons and positrons into vibrations with the transition
energies.

Epola electrons and positrons forced into vibrations transfer the vibrational
energy to their neighbors, and this transfer of vibrational energy is the
propagation of electromagnetic waves. The velocity of this propagation is the
velocity $c$ of epola deformation waves, defined by the binding energy and
mass-density in the epola. Thus, it depends solely on the 'local' conditions in the
epola itself. We may say that the vibrating epola particles have no 'information'
about the conditions and motions of the source, except what is in the energy or
frequency they obtained. They also have no information on the velocity of the
transfer process in other regions of the epola, which the radiation passed before
reaching them. All they have is the energy or frequency to pass on, the inertia,
and the binding and proximity to the neighboring particles, which define how
fast the energy is passed on.

The sole dependence of the propagation velocity of epola waves on the
conditions in the epola causes the radiation, emitted by a moving source, to
propagate in all directions in the epola with the same velocity $c$. However, the
energies and frequencies of radiation emitted in different directions are
different.

Let a particular electron-transition-frequency in the source be $f$. If the source
rests in the epola, then all epola particles around the source are reached in one
second by a number $f$ of vibrations, as emitted by the source, or by a number $f$ of
waves. But when the source moves with velocity $v$, then the epola particles
behind the body are reached by less than $f$ vibrations; as many less as there are
waves in the distance traveled by the source in one second. If propagation with
velocity $c$ delivers $f$ waves in a second, then propagation with velocity $v$ would
deliver as many less waves as $v$ is smaller than $c$. And, in the case of $v = c$ (impossible; 
atomic bodies would disintegrate at $v \ge 0.01 \, c$), none of these vibrations
or waves would reach particles behind the body. Hence, the number of waves
reaching the epola particles behind the body in one second, or the frequency $f'$ of
radiation behind the body is:

$$
f' = f \left(1 - \frac{v}{c} \right)
$$

Epola particles in front of the moving body are reached in one second by
more than $f$ vibrations or waves; as many more as there are waves in the distance
traveled by the emitter in one second, i.e., by $fv/c$ waves. Hence, the number of
waves reaching the epola particles in front of the body in one second, or the
frequency $f'$ of radiation in front of the body is:

$$
f' = f \left(1 + \frac{v}{c} \right)
$$

Replacing $f' - f = \Delta f$, we have, for frequencies in front and behind the moving
emitter,

$$
\frac{\Delta f}{f} = \pm \frac{v}{c}
$$

which is the equation for the Doppler effect. The same formulas were obtained
in the previous section for the moving receiver. Both cases, of the moving source
and of the moving receiver, may therefore be united, with $v$ representing the
velocity of the receiver and the source relative to the epola, keeping in mind that
the two are atomic bodies hence, that $v$ cannot exceed a hundredth of $c$.

Our discussion is also applicable to the re-emission and to the reflection of
radiation absorbed by an atomic body. Obviously, there is no difference in the
propagation of radiation from atoms, whether excited thermally, or by absorbed
radiation, or by any other means. The same propagation conditions are also
valid for radiation reflected by the electron gas.

In our derivation, we actually used the classical rules for velocity addition,
though there is no physical addition of velocities here. The velocity of atomic
bodies does not add to the velocity of light, as velocities of nuclear bodies would,
and as the velocity of water in the river adds to the velocity of the boat. In
general, mathematical treatment worked out for a particular physical process
may be legally and successfully applied to the treatment of distinct processes,
with gain to both physics and mathematics. The trouble to physics starts when
the interpretation of such treatment masks the physical distinctiveness and
particulars; as a final result, there might be no physics left.


### 10.12 Constancy of light-velocity and the Michelson-Morley experiment

We have seen in Section 10.11 that the velocity of light depends solely on the
conditions in the epola. Being determined by the epola binding energy and mass
density, tremendously large, as compared with atomic bodies, the velocity $c$
cannot be affected by atomic bodies, and only bodies of nuclear matter could
cause changes in the epola. Therefore, if the emitter or receiver of electromagnetic
radiation are atomic bodies, then the velocity of light $c$ is independent
of the motion of the emitter and receiver and is the same in all directions.

This conclusion is in full agreement with the results of Michelson-Morley's
experiment, described in Section 1.3. In their experiment, light from a
monochromatic source was split into two beams, one parallel to the direction of
Earth's motion and the other perpendicular to it. After passing slightly
different optical paths, the two beams were brought together, to produce their
interference fringe pattern. Then, the whole apparatus was turned by 90°, so
that the two beams exchanged the directions of their paths. If there were a
difference between the velocities of light along the two paths, then during the
exchange of orientation of the two beams, their interference fringe pattern
should have been shifted.

Thc experiment was performed at different seasons, locations and elevations,
repeated by different workers until 1930, and brought to an accuracy, such
that a difference in 1 km/s in the velocity of light could have been detected.
However, no difference could be found in the velocity of light in directions along
the motion of Earth, perpendicular to it and opposite to it.

Such an agreement of experimental results of Michelson&ndash;Morley and their
continuators, with the conclusions made on the basis of our model, should be
considered as an experimental evidence for the validity of the epola model. All
the more, that it is only the epola model which is able to explain the results of this
experiment, and to do it in a way which is compatible with all known
experiments.

Einstein's conclusions of the Michelson-Morley results are in his Second
Postulate of special relativity (Section 2.1):

> Light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity $c$,
which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body.

Also:

> Any ray of light moves in the 'stationary' system of coordinates, with the
determined velocity $c$, whether the ray be emitted by a stationary or by a
moving body.

If it were allowed to replace the words "'stationary' system of coordinates" by
the word 'epola', the words "is always propagated in empty space" by the words
'propagates in the epola', and to insert "atomic" before the word "body.", then
Einstein's second postulate could become a pillar of the epola model of space.
Except that in the epola model, it does not have to be postulated; it is explained
and derived.
