### 6.1 Half-wave clusters of bulk deformation waves in elastic media

In uniform elastic media, such as gases or bulks of liquids far (deep)
from their surfaces, the only propagating waves are the bulk deformation waves.
They consist of half-wave clusters of increased density, thus increased pressure,
which are followed by half-wave clusters of reduced density, thus reduced
pressure. In other words, in some half-wave clusters, there is an excess number
$\Delta N$ of molecules, $\Delta N > 0$, while in the neighboring half-wave clusters, the
number of molecules is less than the normal number $N$, and $\Delta N$ is negative.
With the tremendous number of molecules in any half-wave cluster, usually
$N >> \Delta N$, and $\Delta N >> 1 \ $ (except in shock-waves: see also Section 7.7).

In each half-wave cluster, the molecules of the substance vibrate (in addition
to the random thermal vibrations) with the frequency of the wave in all possible
directions. Relative to any chosen direction of wave propagation, there are
molecules vibrating along this direction, as well as molecules vibrating in
directions perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Therefore, bulk
deformation waves may show effects of longitudinal and transversal waves,
depending on the means of detection.

A polarizer screen, with a slit in the way of the waves, lets out, in addition to
longitudinal waves, the transverse waves in which molecules vibrate parallel to
the slit. However, the polarizer screen also changes conditions in the wave.
First, due to the increased pressure at the screen. part of the molecules are
forced to change the direction of their vibrations, so that more wave energy is
"squeezed" through the slit. The slit also induces diffraction and interference,
affecting not only the space-distribution of wave-energy, but also the energy
distribution between the different transverse modes and the longitudinal mode
of vibration. These effects will be further enhanced by the analyzer screen,
placed in the way of waves, which passed the polarizer. Hence, the energy
distribution among the various modes of vibration in the waves which passed the
slits does not depict this distribution in the natural bulk deformation wave.

Bulk deformation waves are usually traveling waves, in which during each
half period, the phase of vibrations, e.g., the phase of maximum positive
deflection, and the vibrational energy of each molecule, are transferred a
distance of half a wavelength in any chosen direction of propagation, with a
singular velocity $v_d$ of the bulk deformation waves.


### 6.2 Half-wave clusters in standing waves

Bulk deformation waves can also be standing waves. These result from the
superposition of two waves of identical frequencies and amplitudes traveling in
opposite directions, as, e.g., a direct wave and the reflected wave. In a standing
bulk deformation wave, every molecule vibrates with a constant amplitude, thus
keeping its vibrational energy constant (in addition to the energy of random
vibrations). In the standing half-wave deformation cluster, the molecules on the
boundary of the cluster have zero amplitude and zero vibrational energy. These
values increase towards the center of the cluster, where they reach a maximum.
Hence, while energy is flowing in a standing wave in both directions, there is no
net energy transfer in it.

The pressure in each half-wave cluster of a standing wave is changing in each half
period from maximum to minimum, in phases opposite to those in the
neighboring half-wave standing cluster. Thus, there is a flow of pressure, i.e., of
excess molecules between neighboring clusters. While one cluster has a more
than normal number of molecules, $\Delta N > 0$, the other has slightly less than
normal, $\Delta N < 0$, and on the boundaries of the clusters, the pressure is normal,
$\Delta N = 0$. Because of this flow of pressure or of molecules between the half-wave
clusters, energy can be drawn from a standing wave, though there is no net
energy flow in the wave. This can be achieved, e.g., by inserting a tube or pipe
into the center of a half-wave cluster. Then, energy will flow from the wave
through the "contact" $-$ the mouth of the pipe $-$ right into the pipe.


### 6.3 Velocity calculation or bulk deformation waves in unbounded NaCl crystals

The propagation velocity $v_d$ of bulk deformation waves in a uniform elastic
medium of density $d$ can be expressed through the bulk elastic modulus of the
medium as

$$
\begin{align}
v_d = \left( \frac{2B}{d} \right)^{1/2}
\end{align}
$$

The bulk elastic modulus $B$ is defined as

$$
B = -V \cdot \frac{\delta p}{\delta V}
$$

where $V$ is the volume and $p$ is the hydrostatic pressure. Thus, the bulk elastic
modulus is the rate of change of pressure with the change of volume; it also
represents the elastic energy-density in the medium.

Let us now consider an unbounded $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal so large, that as large as its
single-crystal grains may be, the crystal as a whole is polycrystalline, identical in
all directions, thus representing a uniform elastic medium. In such $\mathrm{NaCl}$ lattice,
the bulk elastic modulus was found to be

$$
B = \frac{{}_b E}{2} \cdot {l_0}^3
$$

where ${}_b E$ and ${l_0}^3$ are the mean binding energy and volume per ion in the lattice.
The velocity $v_d$ is, by substituting the above expression for $B$ into formula 1, therefore,

$$
v_d = \left( \frac{{}_b E}{d} \cdot {l_0}^3 \right)^{1/2}
$$

With $m_i$ as the mean ion mass, the density $d$ is $d = m_i / {l_0}^3$, thus

$$
v_d = \left( \frac{{}_b E}{m_i} \right)^{1/2}
$$

Substituting the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ data: ${}_b E = 4 \ \mathrm{eV}$ and $m_i = 29 \ \mathrm{AMU}$,
we find the velocity $v_d$
of bulk deformation waves in the huge $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal, ${v_d = 3600 \ \mathrm{m/s}}$.


### 6.4 Velocity of sound in NaCl crystals

The velocity of sound $v_s$ in gases and in the bulk of liquids (far from
their surface) is the velocity $v_d$ of bulk deformation waves. In large $\mathrm{NaCl}$
crystals, in which the effects of the surfaces in all directions can be disregarded
(i.e., in crystals not shaped as rods or plates), there are still six different values
for the sound velocity, depending on the direction of propagation in relation
to the directions in the unit cube of the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ lattice and on the mode of vibration
of the sound. These values are presented in the table.

In the unthinkably large $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal, which can be considered as a uniform
elastic medium, the ions in every half-wave cluster are vibrating in all possible
directions, as described in Section 6.1. Because of the unavoidable polycrystallinity
of the huge crystal, all directional differences are averaged out and
the velocity of sound should be the average of all six values listed in the table.
This average value really is 3.6 km/s, exactly equal to the velocity of bulk
deformation waves, calculated in Section 6.3. Thus, the velocity of sound in an
unbounded very large $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal has a unique value equal to the velocity of
bulk deformation waves in this crystal, $v_s = v_d = \left( {}_b E / m_i \right)^{1/2} = 3600 \ \mathrm{m/s}$.
Therefore, sound waves in such $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystals are due to bulk deformation
waves in it.


### 6.5 Velocity calculation of epola deformation waves and of light

The directional differences in the epola may possibly be detected on
distances of up to a billion lattice units, which is a few micrometers. On larger
distances, the directional differences average out, and the epola is a perfectly
uniform elastic medium. Hence, the velocity of bulk deformation waves in the
epola can be calculated in the same way as it was done in the huge $\mathrm{NaCl}$ lattice.
The derived formula for $v_s, v_d = \left( {}_b E / m_i \right)^{1/2}$, can therefore be used in the epola.
Here, the per-particle binding energy ${}_b E$ is $m_e c^2 = 511 \ \mathrm{keV}$, and the average ion
mass $m_i$ is the mass of the electron $m_e$. Substituting these values, we obtain

$$
v_d = \left( \frac{m_e c^2}{m_e} \right)^{1/2}
$$

or

$$
v_d = c
$$

Thus, the velocity of bulk deformation waves in the epola is equal to the unique
vacuum light velocity $c$. In other words, electromagnetic radiation propagates
with the same unique velocity $c$, as do bulk deformation waves in the epola.
Thus, electromagnetic waves and radiation are just as closely connected with
bulk deformation waves in the electron-positron lattice, as sound waves are
connected with bulk deformation waves in the unbounded $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal.


### 6.6 Epola bulk waves and the transverseness of electromagnetic waves

Electromagnetic waves and bulk deformation waves in the epola propagate
with the same velocity $c$, but are not identical. In the epola waves, real particles
are vibrating around their lattice sites with the frequency $f$ of the wave motion.
The waves are multi-faceted, and one of the ways to detect them is through their
electric and magnetic fields, which are caused by the vibrations of the
electrons and positrons in the waves.

The vibrations of the electric and magnetic fields spread throughout with the
velocity and frequency of the bulk deformation waves, causing corresponding
vibrations of electrically charged particles in all reached materials, susceptible
to such vibrations. The vibrations of the electric and magnetic fields are
described by the vibrations of the coupled electric and magnetic vectors $\vec{\varepsilon}$
and $\vec{H}$. These vectors are always found to be perpendicular to each other and to
the direction of their propagation-velocity or the vector $\vec{c}$. This transverseness
of the electromagnetic waves is seemingly opposed to the epola bulk deformation waves,
in which electrons and positrons vibrate in all directions.

Clearly, the electrical charges of all electrons and positrons in equilibrium,
positioned along any chosen direction in the epola, are equal and neutralize
each other perfectly. When these electrons and positrons come into vibrations
along this chosen direction, there is no violation of charge neutrality along this
direction, because in longitudinal vibrations electrons or positrons do not cross
the line of the chosen direction. Their numbers remain equal to each other and
their charges neutralize each other as perfectly as in equilibrium. Therefore, the
longitudinal component $\varepsilon_l$ of the electric vector along any chosen direction of
wave propagation in the epola, caused by the vibrations of epola particles along
this direction, is always zero, $\varepsilon_l = 0$.

Electrons and positrons of the epola, vibrating in directions perpendicular to
the chosen direction of propagation, cross the lines of this direction in equal
numbers, i.e., the negative charge above the lines is always equal to the
positive charge below them. Therefore, these vibrations, too, do not cause any
deviations from charge neutrality *along* the chosen direction. Hence, they do
not contribute to the longitudinal component $\varepsilon_l$ of the electric vector, which
remains zero. However, these vibrations change the amounts of electrical
charge in directions perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. This
results in a vibrating transverse component $\varepsilon_t$, of the electric vector. In points
where the *positive* charge of the perpendicularly deflected epola particles to one
side of the chosen direction is maximal, the transverse component $\varepsilon_t$ of the
electric vector has maximum, $\varepsilon_t = \mathrm{max}$. In points where the *negative* charge of
the perpendicularly deflected epola particles has a maximum, the transverse
component of the electric vector has a maximum in the opposite direction,
$\varepsilon_t = - \mathrm{max}$.

Epola electrons and positrons vibrating in directions other than *along* the
chosen direction or *perpendicular* to it, contribute to the transverse component
of the electric vector only with their deflection-component which is perpendicular
to the chosen direction. The component of their deflection *along* the chosen
direction does not contribute to the longitudinal component of the electric
vector, which is always zero.

The zero value of the longitudinal electric vector also yields a zero value of its
coupled magnetic vector. The non-zero value of the transverse electric vector
produces a non-zero coupled magnetic vector. To summarize,

> the transverseness of the electromagnetic waves is due to the fact that, for
any deflection of an electron or positron of the epola, the deviation from
charge neutrality is largest perpendicular to the deflection, while along the
deflection charge neutrality is not violated.

Therefore,

> the oscillations of the epola particles along any direction of propagation of
the electromagnetic wave (or the maternal bulk deformation wave) do not
contribute to $\vec{\varepsilon}$ and $\vec{H}$; hence, the longitudinal components of $\vec{\varepsilon}$
and $\vec{H}$ are always zero.

We may conclude that electromagnetic radiation is an observable result of epola
bulk deformation waves. It is also right to say that electromagnetic radiation
causes bulk deformation waves in the epola, or that

> electromagnetic radiation is both the observed result and the observed cause
of bulk deformation waves in the epola.


### 6.7 The epola as carrier of electromagnetic radiation

The fact that electromagnetic radiation is caused by and also causes bulk
deformation waves in the epola, suggests that the epola is the carrier of
electromagnetic radiation. As such, the epola is not an ether. The density of the
epola, calculated as

$$
d = \frac{m_e}{{l_0}^3} = 10^{13} \ \mathrm{kg / m^3}
$$

is $10^5$ times smaller than that of 'dense' particles, electrons, atomic nuclei and
nuclear matter. However, the epola is almost a billion times denser than the
densest solids on Earth and has a binding energy $10^5$ times larger than these
solids.

From the epola viewpoint, atoms and atomic bodies (including ourselves) are
conglomerates of loosely connected particles, separated from each other by $10^4$
epola lattice constants. The bodies may move undisturbedly through the epola,
sweeping their atomic electrons and nuclei in channels between the epola
particles. This, provided that the epola particles move apart when their lattice
unit is entered by an electron or nucleus of the atomic body. Such 'opening of
the gates' in the epola units in front of the moving particles and closing of the gates
behind them is a wave motion in the epola. It will be shown later that this wave
motion has the de Broglie wavelength of the moving particle and is responsible
for making the epola vacuum-transparent for the motion of the particle and of
the whole atomic body, to which the particle belongs (Section 8.1).

Our conclusion is that in the motion of Earth around the Sun, the production
of epola waves with the corresponding de Broglie wavelengths is the only effect
on the epola. Obviously, the motion cannot drag the epola, nor can it cause in it
the wind, expected of an ether in Michelson-Morley's experiment. Only bodies
of nuclear matter can cause such effects. Compared with the density of the
epola, it is the Earth and earthy bodies which are the etherous ones. This
contradicts our natural perception of the emptiness or etherosity of space, which
we proved false, based on Anderson's experiments (Chapter 4). It also
contradicts the natural perception of earthy objects and ourselves as bodies of
continuous dense matter, proven false by Rutherford.

Except for contradicting our mentioned natural perceptions, the epola as
carrier of electromagnetic radiation is in full agreement with all observed
phenomena and experimental results. With the epola as such carrier, all these
phenomena and experiments are given a full physical explanation without
hiding behind complicated mathematical derivations and ad hoc invented
postulates and principles.


### 6.8 Derivation of the mass-energy equivalence

With the energy $m_e c^2 = 0.51 \ \mathrm{MeV}$ proven to be the binding energy ${}_b E$ of the
epola particle (Section 4.5) we have calculated the velocity $v_d$ of epola bulk
deformation waves, $v_d = \left( {}_b E / m_e \right)^{1/2}$ and shown that it is equal to the vacuum
light velocity $c$ (Section 6.5). Let us rewrite the formulas for the velocity $v_d$ of
bulk deformation waves (Sections 6.3, 6.5), to read

$$
{}_b E = m_i \cdot {v_d}^2
$$

for the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ lattice, and

$$
{}_b E = m_e c^2
$$

for the epola.

The binding energy ${}_b E$ is the mean energy of freeing an ion or particle of its
bonds in these lattices. Therefore, the formulas say that

> to free ions or particles of their bonds in a (fcc) lattice, one must supply to
them energy, equal to their mass, multiplied by the velocity-squared of bulk
deformation waves in the lattice. This energy is released in the lattice
when an ion or particle is caught or entrapped into the lattice.

Multiplying the formula ${}_b E = m_e c^2$ by an arbitrary integer $n$, so that
$n \cdot {}_b E = E$, and $n \cdot m_e = m$, we obtain

$$
E = m c^2
$$

This is Einstein's equation for the equivalence of mass and energy. The
equivalence is therefore a direct consequence of the epola structure of space. In
the epola here and in it only, $0.51 \ \mathrm{MeV}$ is *equivalent* to the electron mass $m_e$
because $0.51 \ \mathrm{MeV}$ is half the energy of freeing an electron-positron pair from its
bonds. However, as is known, $0.51 \ \mathrm{MeV}$ is much less than the not-yet-known
energy, which might really create or destroy an electron.

We must point out that in the $E = m c^2$ formula, $E$ is a radiative energy, i.e.,
energy of epola waves, emitted or absorbed in the epola when the mass $m$ of
electrons and positrons or of similar dense particles is caught into the epola or
freed from it. Thus, $E$ and $m$ are not just any energy and any mass. So it also was
in Einstein's derivation; his extrapolation onto any energy and any ponderable
mass was unjustifiable (see Sections 2.3, 2.6).


### 6.9 The Mass-energy equivalence in the NaCl crystal

In the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ lattice, with $v_d = v_s$, the velocity of sound, we have

$$
{}_b E = m_i \cdot {v_s}^2
$$

Multiplying by the arbitrary integer $n$, so that $n \cdot {}_b E = E$, and $n \cdot m_i = m$, we
have

$$
E = m \cdot {v_s}^2
$$

This is the mass-energy equivalence formula for the unbound huge $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal.
In it and in it only, $8 \ \mathrm{eV}$ is equivalent to $58 \ \mathrm{AMU}$ (or to $110,000 \ m_e$), because
$8 \ \mathrm{eV}$ is sufficient to free an $\mathrm{Na^+}$ $\mathrm{Cl^-}$ ion pair of its bonds, making the
$58 \ \mathrm{AMU}$ mass appear in the lattice. Obviously, $8 \ \mathrm{eV}$ cannot create $58 \ \mathrm{AMU}$.

By virtue of the above, we may conclude that in both the epola and the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ lattice,

> the mass-energy 'equivalence' formulas result from the lattice structure of the
media and express energy relations for the freeing of masses or for their
entrapment, not for their real creation or destruction.


### 6.10 The rocksalters' mass-energy saga

Let us conceive a tremendously huge rocksalt crystal with imaginary
intelligent creatures floating in it. Being unable to detect the $\mathrm{Na^+}$ and $\mathrm{Cl^-}$ ions
bound to the lattice sites in the crystal, the rocksalters have no indication on the
existence of the crystal. Therefore, they consider themselves living in an
emptiness, a rocksalters' vacuum. As their scientific knowledge developed, they
observed some strange limitations, enforced on positions and motions in this
vacuum. However, by introducing no less strange postulates, principles and
exclusions, they somehow found ways to account for the observed limitations.
Thereafter, each time when calculations did not fit new facts, they would make
them fit by adding new postulates, space-dimensions or exotic particles. In
such a manner, through a complete denial of physical causality, they could keep
the idea of the emptiness of their space. This success made the rocksalters
believe that the ability to calculate is the only thing which matters and the only
proof of truth, that physical understanding is not only impossible but
also meaningless, and that the natural desire for such understanding is a sign of
ignorance, if not a sin.

Having developed 'high-energy' techniques, the rocksalt creatures
observed, that when $8 \ \mathrm{eV}$ of energy are absorbed in their vacuum, out of it a
sodium and a chlorine ion may appear, and that when such a pair of ions
disappears, $8 \ \mathrm{eV}$ of energy emerges. The appearance of the ion pair is then
interpreted as its creation out of nothing by the $8 \ \mathrm{eV}$ of energy; the reverse
disappearance of the ion pair is its 'obvious' annihilation into nothing, by
emitting $8 \ \mathrm{eV}$ of energy. This interpretation necessarily leads to a conclusion
that $8 \ \mathrm{eV}$ must be equivalent to the mass of the ion pair, i.e., to $58 \ \mathrm{AMU}$,
otherwise it would not be able to create the pair. With the use of very
complicated mathematics, the rocksalters had previously derived their formula
for the equivalence of mass and energy,

$$
E = m {v_s}^2
$$

wbere $v_s$ is the rocksalt-vacuum sound velocity, proclaimed as a universal
constant. Substituting the value of $m_i$,

$$
m_i = 58 \ \mathrm{AMU} \cdot 1.66 \cdot 10^{-27} \ \mathrm{kg/AMU} \\
{= 9.6 \cdot 10^{-26} \ \mathrm{kg}}
$$

and the value of $v_s$,

$$
v_s = 3600 \ \mathrm{m/s}
$$

they obtained

$$
E = 1.25 \cdot 10^{-18} \ \mathrm{J} \cdot 6.25 \cdot 10^{18} \ \mathrm{eV / J} \\
= 8 \ \mathrm{eV}
$$

This result represented a triumph for the rocksalters' interpretations of their
vacuum space, of ion creation out of it and of ion annihilation into it, as well as
for the genius of their mathematicians. A rocksalter was trying to spoil the
jubilation by reiterating that the $8 \ \mathrm{eV}$ is just the binding energy of the ion-pair
to an undetected $\mathrm{NaCl}$ lattice, and that the celebrated mass-energy formula is
just a formula for the velocity of sound in this lattice. However, his harm was
minimal, because he was not allowed to publish his crazy ideas and nobody had
the time and willingness to listen to him.
