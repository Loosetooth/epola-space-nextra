## Foreword

This book is aimed at readers with at least a basic education in physics. It provides a model, on the basis of which phenomena of contemporary physics can be understood and their laws derived with the aid of simple calculus. It should please readers who cannot stand the postulatory way in which laws, rules, and formulas of quantum physics and relativity are introduced or enforced in our courses and texts; readers who ask their "why's", though the answers reduce to: "this is the way it is".

With the electron-positron lattice model of space developed here, physical phenomena considered inexplicable are explained, physical laws and postulates considered underivable are derived, and physical magnitudes considered uncalculable are calculated. Hopefully, in an understandable way, because making able and willing listeners and readers understand is the only proof of one's own understanding.
