### 7.1 Stabilization of epola wave motions and frequency invariance

Let us follow the beginning of a harmonic oscillation with frequency $f$ or
period $T \equiv 1 / f$, of a single epola particle in an otherwise undisturbed epola. At
the moment $t = 0$ the particle, marked $O$, is in equilibrium position, having
velocity ${v_0 << c}$. During the first quarter period, or the time $T/4$ of the
amplitudinal deflection of particle $O$, the disturbance spreads throughout with
the velocity $v_d$ of epola bulk deformation waves, $v_d = \left( {}_b E / m_e \right)^{1/2}$, which is equal
to the vacuum light velocity $c$ (Sections 6.3. 6.5). At $t = T/4$, the surrounding
particles, swept gradually into motion, form a primary spherical deformation
cluster with a radius $R_{cl} = c \cdot T/4$. During the second quarter period, or time
from $t = T/4$ to $t = T/2$ the particle $O$ returns to the equilibrium position, and a
return signal travels through the cluster to move its particles in the opposite
direction, while the first signal of the initial deflection is transferred with the
velocity $c$ further out to form the neighboring clusters, and so on.

The general principle of wave motion, discovered by Huygens and used ever
since in all wave constructions, is that

> every point in space reached by a wave motion can be considered as a
center of propagation of a new spherical wave.

To make Huygens's principle applicable for the epola we shall rephrase it as
follows:

> every lattice particle reached by an epola wave is forced to vibrate with the
frequency of the wave; therefore, it acts as a center of a new spherical epola
wave.

Part of the energy of the new spherical waves, formed by each and every
particle in the epola wave, returns to the 'initiating' particle $O$ and to the
'primary' half-wave deformation cluster. Therefore, every epola particle in the
wave is subject to an infinite number of signals or 'move!' orders, interfering
with each other. An epola wave motion can be established if as a result of this
interference in each particle, the vibrations of the primary cluster, as well as of
any other half-wave deformation cluster of the wave motion, do come into
compliance with the returning signals from clusters formed further and further
away. Otherwise the primary vibration is damped and its energy is transferred to
the random vibrations of epola particles around their lattice sites. Obviously,
the interference conditions become much more complicated and severe in the
presence of guest particles, atoms and bodies of atoms in the epola. This points
out that not every or any vibration of epola particles or even systems of epola
particles do establish a wave motion in the epola.

Once a wave motion is established in the epola, then the vibration of every
epola particle in the wave is linked with quadrillions of particles, interconnected
with each other and vibrating with the same compliant frequency. Therefore, if
some factor would try to change the frequency of a particle or of a group of
particles, the quadrillions of the other particles in the wave-motion will restore
the compliant frequency. This explains the observed stability of the frequency or
the principle of "frequency invariance". The frequency of wave motions in the
epola is preserved even when the waves pass through regions containing bodies
of atoms or through otherwise distorted zones.


### 7.2 Half-wave clusters in epola compressibility waves

Epola bulk deformation waves can be compressibility waves, which are
waves of long and medium wavelengths, and shock or impact waves, of short
and very short wavelengths. In compressibility waves the half-wave deformation
clusters have instantaneous spherical symmetry, so that the volume of the
cluster and the equilibrium number $N_{cl}$ of epola particles in it is proportional to
the third power of the wavelength, $N_{cl} \propto {\lambda}^3$.

The deformation in the cluster is due to the excess epola particles, which
entered the cluster or left it because of their vibrations in the wave motion. As
long as the lattice remains intact, the excess particles, pushed into the half-wave
cluster or pulled out of it can only be particles of the boundary layer of the
cluster. Therefore, the number $\Delta N$ of the excess particles is proportional to the
outer area of the half-wave cluster, or to the square of the wavelengt, $\Delta N \propto {\lambda}^2$.

Every excess epola particle entering the cluster brings in an amount of
energy equal to its binding energy $m_e c^2$, and every leaving particle takes this
energy out. Therefore, the deformation energy $E_{cl}$ of a half-wave epola
deformation cluster is proportional to the number $\Delta N$ of excess particles in it,
thus to the square of the wavelength, $E_{cl} \propto \Delta N \propto {\lambda}^2$.

The average deformation energy $E_p$ per particle in the cluster, i.e., the energy
of the cluster divided by the number of particles in it, is, therefore, inversely
proportional to the wavelength

$$
E_p = \frac{\Delta N}{N_{cl}} \propto \frac{1}{\lambda}
$$


### 7.3 Definition of photons in the epola and phonons in solids

The transfer of energy in the epola wave-motion can be represented by the
motion of half-wave deformation clusters, or also by the transfer of the average
per-particle energy $E_p$ in the half-wave cluster from particle to particle along any
direction in the wave motion. This transfer of energy $E_p$ can be considered as the
motion of a quasi-particle having this energy and moving with the velocity $c$ of
the wave motion. Our definition of the photon is, hence:

> The photon is an imaginary quasi-particle depicting the transfer of energy in
an electromagnetic wave. The photon energy or the quantum of energy in
this wave is the average energy transferred from one epola particle to the
next in line in the epola wave motion.

The first sentence in this definition agrees with the original definition given
by Einstein in 1905. The second part expresses the meaning of the photon in the
epola. This meaning is in full agreement with all observed phenomena in which
photons are involved. It releases the obscurity of the photon cancept in quantum
theory (Section 3.3).

In our definition the photon is not a real particle and does not represent a
real particle. It does not even represent the vibrational energy of a real particle
in the epola wave motion, because this energy is proportional to the square of
the amplitude of the particle. It only represents the per-particle part of the
energy, transferred in the wave motion.

Our definition of the photon can also be used to define the phonon in solids
(or liquids) by inserting the appropriate terms. Thus:

> The phonon is an imaginary quasi-particle, depicting the transfer of energy
in an elastic wave or sound wave in a solid (or liquid). The phonon energy
or the quantum of energy in this wave is the average energy, transferred
from one ion, atom or molecule of the body to the next in line in the wave
motion.

What was said about the nature of the photon relates also to the phonon.
However, as in the case of the epola$-\mathrm{NaCl}$ lattice analogy (Section 5.1), the
photon-phonon analogy cannot be driven too far. Material bodies are much
more complex than the epola, so that the phonon concept is also more complex
and diverse than the photon concept. However, our derivation of the photon
energy, of Planck's law and of Planck's constant can be carried out on phonons
in crystalline solids as well.


### 7.4 Derivation of Planck's Law

We found that the energy $E_p$ transferred from particle to particle, thus the
energy of the photon, is inversely proportional to the wavelength of the epola
wave motion, $E_p \propto 1 / \lambda$. We may write this proportionality in the form
$E_p \cdot \lambda = \mathrm{const}$, meaning that the photon energy in any epola wave motion, multiplied by
the wavelength of this motion, is a constant. This can also be written in the form

$$
E_p \cdot \lambda = E' \cdot \lambda '
$$

where $E' \cdot \lambda '$ is the outcome of any experiment, in which the photon energy $E'$ is
measured together with the corresponding wavelength $\lambda '$. Such can be, e.g., the
photon energy $E_c = m_e c^2$ of the electromagnetic wave with the Compton
wavelength $\lambda_c = 2426 \ \mathrm{fm}$. Therefore,

$$
\begin{align*}
E_p \cdot \lambda &= E' \cdot \lambda ' \\
&= E_c \cdot \lambda_c \\
&= 511 \ \mathrm{keV} \times 2426 \ \mathrm{fm} \\
&= 1.24 \ \mathrm{eV} \cdot \mathrm{\mu m}
\end{align*}
$$

Replacing $\lambda$ by $c / f$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
E_p & = \left( \frac{E' \cdot \lambda'}{c} \right) \cdot f \\
& = \left( \frac{1.24 \ \mathrm{eV} \cdot \mathrm{\mu m}}{300 \ \mathrm{Mm / s}} \right) \cdot f
\end{align*}
$$

or

$$
E_p = hf
$$

which is Planck's Law. Here,

$$
\begin{align*}
h & = \frac{E_c \lambda_c}{c} \\
& = \frac{1.24 \ \mathrm{eV} \cdot \mathrm{\mu m}}{300 \ \mathrm{Mm / s}} \\
& = 4.14 \ \mathrm{feV} \cdot s \\
& = 6.63 \cdot 10^{-34} \ \mathrm{J \cdot s}
\end{align*}
$$

is Planck's constant.


### 7.5 The Compton Wave in the epola

According to our description of epola compressibility waves, the shortest
wave of this kind would be a wave with a single excess particle in the half-wave
deformation cluster. The deformation energy of this cluster is then equal to the
binding energy of this single particle, or to $m_e c^2$. However, the transfer of the
energy of a single excess particle to the next particle of the cluster can only be
described by a single photon having the energy of the excess particle. This means
that the single excess particle which entered the cluster transfers the $m_e c^2$ energy
to the nearest epola particle, this particle transfers it to the next in line and so on.
Thus, for $\Delta N = 1$, the number of photons $N_p$ in the half-wave cluster is $N_p = 1$
and the energy of the photon is equal to the energy of the cluster,

$$
\begin{align*}
E_p &= E_{cl} \\
& = \Delta N \cdot m_e c^2 \\
& = m_ec^2
\end{align*}
$$

It was experimentally established and it also follows from Planck's law, that
an electromagnetic wave with photon energy $m_e c^2$ has the Compton wavelength
$\lambda_c = h / m_e c = 2426 \ \mathrm{fm}$.

We shall refer to such wave as the Compton wave.

The diameter of the half-wave deformation cluster of the Compton wave is
$1213 \ \mathrm{fm}$ and the number $N_d$ of epola particles across this diameter is

$$
\begin{align*}
N_d &= \frac{\lambda_c}{2 l_0} \\
& = \frac{1213 \ \mathrm{fm}}{4.4 \ \mathrm{fm}} \\
& \approx 280
\end{align*}
$$

If spherical symmetry can still be assumed, then the number of epola particles in
this cluster is

$$
\begin{align*}
N_{cl} &= \left( \frac{4 \pi}{3} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{\lambda_c}{4 l_0} \right) \\
& = 1.1 \cdot 10^7
\end{align*}
$$


### 7.6 Characteristic relations for epola compressibility waves

The characteristic values found for the Compton wave can be used as
proportionality factors in the expressions for the half-wave deformation clusters
of epola waves. We did it already in our derivation of Planck's law (Section 7.4)
when we substituted for $E' \lambda'$ the known values of the photon energy $E_c = m_e c^2$
and the wavelength $\lambda_c = 2426 \ \mathrm{fm}$ of the Compton wave. The derived standard
expression for Planck's law may thus be replaced by

$$
\begin{align*}
E_p &= \frac{E_c \cdot \lambda_c}{\lambda} \\
& = \frac{m_e c^2 \cdot \lambda_c}{\lambda} \\
& = \frac{1.24 \ \mathrm{eV} \cdot \mathrm{\mu m}}{\lambda}
\end{align*}
$$

The proportionality expression for the equilibrium number $N_{cl}$ of epola
particles in a half-wave cluster, $N_{cl} \propto \lambda^3$ can now be replaced by
$N_{cl} / 1.1 \cdot 10^7 = \lambda^3 / {\lambda_c}^3$, leading to

$$
N_{cl} = 1.1 \cdot 10^7 \left( \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_c} \right)^3
$$

The number $\Delta N$ of excess particles, $\Delta N \propto \lambda^2$ is correct for $\lambda > \lambda_c$. With the
Compton-wave value of $\Delta N = 1$ we may rewrite the proportionality as $\Delta N / 1 = \lambda^2 / {\lambda_c}^2$,
so that

$$
\Delta N = \left( \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_c} \right)^2
$$

The number $N_d$ of epola particles along the diameter of the cluster is
proportional to the wavelength, so that $N_d / 280 = \lambda / \lambda_c$, thus

$$
N_d = 280 \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_c} = \frac{\lambda}{2 l_0}
$$

The energy $E_{cl}$ of the cluster, $E_{cl} \propto \Delta N$, or $E_{cl} / E_c = \Delta N / 1$, is thus

$$
\begin{align*}
E_{cl} &= E_c \cdot \Delta N \\
& = m_e c^2 \left( \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_c} \right)^2
\end{align*}
$$

The number $N_p$ of photons in the cluster, multiplied by the photon energy $E_p$
must be equal to the energy $E_{cl}$ of the cluster *at any instant*, because of energy conservation:

$$
E_{cl} = N_p \cdot E_p
$$

Therefore,

$$
\begin{align*}
N_p &= \frac{E_{cl}}{E_p} \\
& = \frac
  {\displaystyle m_e c^2 \left(\displaystyle \frac{\lambda}{\displaystyle \lambda_c} \right)^2}
  {\displaystyle m_e c^2 \left( \frac{\displaystyle \lambda_c}{\displaystyle \lambda} \right)}
\\
& = \left( \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_c} \right)^3
\end{align*}
$$

It is seen, that $N_p$ is $1.1 \cdot 10^7$ times smaller than $N_{cl}$. This means that
in any half-wave deformation cluster of an epola compressibility wave
there is at any instant one photon per every 11 million epola particles.
The derived expressions for $N_{cl}$, $\Delta N$, $N_d$ and $N_p$ are plotted against the photon
energies, the frequency and wavelength of the epola (electromagnetic) waves in
Figure 4, to the left of $\lambda = \lambda_c$

Abscissas are the photon energy, in units of $m_e c^2$ (lowest axis) and in $\mathrm{eV}$,
the frequency $f$ in $\mathrm{Hz}$, the
wavelength in $\mathrm{m}$ and in units of the Compton $\lambda_c$. $N_d$ is the number of epola particles along
the diameter of the $\lambda / 2$ deformation cluster, $N_p$ is the number of photons, $\Delta N$ - the number of
excess particles, and $N_{cl}$ - of equilibrium particles in the $\lambda / 2$ cluster. The vertical dotted line
connecting points $E = m_e c^2$, $\lambda = \lambda_c$, $\Delta N = N_p = 1$, divides between
compressibility and impact waves.
The right edge vertical line corresponds to the shortest epola wave,
$\lambda = 2 l_0 = 8.8 \ \mathrm{fm} = \lambda_c / 280$,
$f = 3.4 \cdot 10^{22} \ \mathrm{Hz}$, and
$E_p = 280 \ m_e c^2 = 140 \ \mathrm{MeV}$. (Section 7.10)
