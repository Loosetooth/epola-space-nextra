### 5.1 Analogy with the NaCl crystal lattice

Our acceptance of the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal lattice as the closest solid-state analog of the electron-positron lattice is based on several reasons. First, the epola analog must be an alkali-halide crystal because of the equality of the electrical charges of their positive ions (e.g., $\mathrm{Na^+}$) to the charge $+e$ of the positron, and of their negative ions (e.g., $\mathrm{Cl^-}$) to the charge $-e$ of the electron. Also, in terms of the types of crystal bonds, the epola bonds correspond to 'fully ionic'. Therefore, the crystal bonding of the analog must have the highest possible rate of ionicity, which again leads to the alkali halides.

Second, the equality of the masses $m_e$ of the electron and the positron requires that the ion masses of the analog be as close as possible to one another. Therefore, the best choice would be $\mathrm{KCl}$, with $m_{\mathrm{K}} = 39 \mathrm{AMU}$ and $m_{\mathrm{Cl}} = 35 \mathrm{AMU}$. However, the symmetry in the inner structure of the electron and positron suggests that the electronic shell structure of the alkali and the halide atoms should be similar, i.e., they should belong to the same period in the periodic table of elements. Such are the $\mathrm{Na}$ and $\mathrm{Cl}$ atoms, $\left( m_{\mathrm{Na}} = 23 \mathrm{AMU},\  m_{\mathrm{Cl}} = 35 \mathrm{AMU} \right)$. Both belong to the third period, have the same filled inner shells (two electrons on the $s$-shell and eight electrons on the $d$-shell), and the same unfilled outer shell (one $p$-electron in $\mathrm{Na}$, seven $p$-electrons in $\mathrm{Cl}$). The atomic masses of other alkali and halide atom pairs from a common period have more diverse masses $\left( m_{\mathrm{Li}} = 7, m_{\mathrm{F}} = 19; \ m_{\mathrm{K}} = 39, m_{\mathrm{Br}} = 80 \mathrm{AMU} \right)$.

Third, the binding energy in the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal is the largest among the alkali-halide crystals, which fits the strength of the bond between electrons and positrons. Then, the face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice structure of the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal is most common: it is represented more or less exactly in 17 out of the 20 alkali halide crystals. It should be noted., however, that our calculations based on the analogy with the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal would not be significantly affected by the use of some other alkali halide crystal as analog.

The analogy with the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal cannot be drawn too far. One should bear in mind that electrons and positrons are particles of dense matter, with density comparable to that of the nucleons and nuclei. The internal binding of the subparticles, of which the electrons and positrons consist, by far exceeds the GeV range. Ions, on the other hand, are planetary systems, in which only a $10^{-15}$ part of the volume is occupied by dense particles, the electrons and the nucleus; the rest of the volume is as empty as the vacuum space. The supposed spherical symmetry of the ions is very problematic and very easily affected by split eV energies, thus very susceptible to the presence, the location, the rotations, vibrations and what not of the neighbors. Therefore, in crystals we observe directional effects, strong effects of the internal and surface boundaries and other effects. Contrarily, the epola is expected to be incomparably uniform and homogeneous, with probable directional effects observable only in the micrometer range.


### 5.2 Formation and stability of a NaCl molecule

The ability of electrons and positrons to form a lattice can be derived from their ability to form an $e^-e^+$ pair. The types of forces or interactions needed to form the $e^-e^+$ lattice or its analog &ndash; the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ lattice, are the same as needed to form the $e^-e^+$ pair or its analog &ndash; the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ molecule. We shall therefore start
with the formation of an $\mathrm{NaCl}$ molecule out of the $\mathrm{Na^+}$ and $\mathrm{Cl^-}$ ions.

The fact is that as long as the distance $l$ between the $\mathrm{Na^+}$ and the $\mathrm{Cl^-}$ ions is
larger than twice their distance $l_0$ in the $\mathrm{Na^+ Cl^-}$ molecule $\left(l_0 \approx 300 \ \mathrm{pm} \right)$, their interaction is an electrostatic attraction between two point charges of $+e$ and $-e$, described by Coulomb's Law,

$$
F = \frac{k e^2}{l^2}.
$$

Here, $F$ is the attractive force acting on each of the charges, and $k = 9 \ \mathrm{Gm/F}$ is an SI units factor.

According to the laws of electrostatics, a system of charges can act as a point charge, if the charges of the system are distributed homogeneously on concentric spherical surfaces, or in an equivalent way. The electrostatic field outside the outermost surface is then identical to the field, which would be created there by a point charge, positioned in the common center of the spheres and equal to the algebraic sum of their charges. Therefore, the $\mathrm{Na^+}$ can act as a $+e$ point charge, if the $+11 \ e$ charge of its nucleus and the $-10 \ e$ charge of its orbital electrons are homogeneously distributed on concentric spheres. Similarly, the $\mathrm{Cl^-}$ ion can act as a $-e$ point charge if the $+17 \ e$ charge of its nucleus and the $-18 \ e$ charge of its orbital electrons are distributed homogeneously on concentric spheres.

Further facts are that when the distance $l$ between the ions decreases below $2 l_0$, their attraction weakens, reaching zero at $l = l_0$, i.e., when the molecule is formed. If the ions are then forced to a distance smaller than $l_0$ (e.g., by outside pressure on the substance) they repel each other, and the repulsion steeply increases with decreasing distance. This behavior is depicted by the plots of the attractive and repulsive energies as functions of distance in Figure 1.

The repulsive interaction appears in addition to the electrostatic attraction when the distance between the ions is smaller than $2 l_0$. This means that while the electrostatic interaction has an infinite range, the repulsive interaction has a
range shorter than $2 l_0$. It is therefore named 'the short-range repulsion'. The attraction between the ions at $l = l_0$ being zero means that in the molecule the short-range repulsion and the electrostatic attraction forces are equal to each other and the total energy of the two interactions has a minimum. (See Figure 1.) Thus, the two interactions together provide the stability of the molecule.

$l_0$  is the equilibrium distance between the ions in the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ molecule or lattice, also between the electron and positron in the $e^- e^+$ pair or lattice. ${}_{es}E_0$ is the electrostatic attraction energy ${}_{es}E$ at $l = l_0$. ${}_{sr}E$ is the short-range repulsion energy, and ${}_tE$ is the total energy, attractive for $l > l_0$ and repulsive for $l < l_0$ ; at $l = l_0$, ${}_tE$ has a minimum value, which is the binding energy ${}_bE$. In the lattices, ${}_bE = 0.9 \ {}_{es}E$ (Sections 5.4, 5.6).
