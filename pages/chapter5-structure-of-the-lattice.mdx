### 5.1 Analogy with the NaCl crystal lattice

Our acceptance of the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal lattice as the closest solid-state analog of the electron-positron lattice is based on several reasons. First, the epola analog must be an alkali-halide crystal because of the equality of the electrical charges of their positive ions (e.g., $\mathrm{Na^+}$) to the charge $+e$ of the positron, and of their negative ions (e.g., $\mathrm{Cl^-}$) to the charge $-e$ of the electron. Also, in terms of the types of crystal bonds, the epola bonds correspond to 'fully ionic'. Therefore, the crystal bonding of the analog must have the highest possible rate of ionicity, which again leads to the alkali halides.

Second, the equality of the masses $m_e$ of the electron and the positron requires that the ion masses of the analog be as close as possible to one another. Therefore, the best choice would be $\mathrm{KCl}$, with $m_{\mathrm{K}} = 39 \mathrm{AMU}$ and $m_{\mathrm{Cl}} = 35 \mathrm{AMU}$. However, the symmetry in the inner structure of the electron and positron suggests that the electronic shell structure of the alkali and the halide atoms should be similar, i.e., they should belong to the same period in the periodic table of elements. Such are the $\mathrm{Na}$ and $\mathrm{Cl}$ atoms, $\left( m_{\mathrm{Na}} = 23 \mathrm{AMU},\  m_{\mathrm{Cl}} = 35 \mathrm{AMU} \right)$. Both belong to the third period, have the same filled inner shells (two electrons on the $s$-shell and eight electrons on the $d$-shell), and the same unfilled outer shell (one $p$-electron in $\mathrm{Na}$, seven $p$-electrons in $\mathrm{Cl}$). The atomic masses of other alkali and halide atom pairs from a common period have more diverse masses $\left( m_{\mathrm{Li}} = 7, m_{\mathrm{F}} = 19; \ m_{\mathrm{K}} = 39, m_{\mathrm{Br}} = 80 \mathrm{AMU} \right)$.

Third, the binding energy in the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal is the largest among the alkali-halide crystals, which fits the strength of the bond between electrons and positrons. Then, the face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice structure of the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal is most common: it is represented more or less exactly in 17 out of the 20 alkali halide crystals. It should be noted., however, that our calculations based on the analogy with the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal would not be significantly affected by the use of some other alkali halide crystal as analog.

The analogy with the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal cannot be drawn too far. One should bear in mind that electrons and positrons are particles of dense matter, with density comparable to that of the nucleons and nuclei. The internal binding of the subparticles, of which the electrons and positrons consist, by far exceeds the GeV range. Ions, on the other hand, are planetary systems, in which only a $10^{-15}$ part of the volume is occupied by dense particles, the electrons and the nucleus; the rest of the volume is as empty as the vacuum space. The supposed spherical symmetry of the ions is very problematic and very easily affected by split eV energies, thus very susceptible to the presence, the location, the rotations, vibrations and what not of the neighbors. Therefore, in crystals we observe directional effects, strong effects of the internal and surface boundaries and other effects. Contrarily, the epola is expected to be incomparably uniform and homogeneous, with probable directional effects observable only in the micrometer range.


### 5.2 Formation and stability of a NaCl molecule

The ability of electrons and positrons to form a lattice can be derived from their ability to form an $e^-e^+$ pair. The types of forces or interactions needed to form the $e^-e^+$ lattice or its analog &ndash; the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ lattice, are the same as needed to form the $e^-e^+$ pair or its analog &ndash; the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ molecule. We shall therefore start
with the formation of an $\mathrm{NaCl}$ molecule out of the $\mathrm{Na^+}$ and $\mathrm{Cl^-}$ ions.

The fact is that as long as the distance $l$ between the $\mathrm{Na^+}$ and the $\mathrm{Cl^-}$ ions is
larger than twice their distance $l_0$ in the $\mathrm{Na^+ Cl^-}$ molecule $\left(l_0 \approx 300 \ \mathrm{pm} \right)$, their interaction is an electrostatic attraction between two point charges of $+e$ and $-e$, described by Coulomb's Law,

$$
F = \frac{k e^2}{l^2}.
$$

Here, $F$ is the attractive force acting on each of the charges, and $k = 9 \ \mathrm{Gm/F}$ is an SI units factor.

According to the laws of electrostatics, a system of charges can act as a point charge, if the charges of the system are distributed homogeneously on concentric spherical surfaces, or in an equivalent way. The electrostatic field outside the outermost surface is then identical to the field, which would be created there by a point charge, positioned in the common center of the spheres and equal to the algebraic sum of their charges. Therefore, the $\mathrm{Na^+}$ can act as a $+e$ point charge, if the $+11 \ e$ charge of its nucleus and the $-10 \ e$ charge of its orbital electrons are homogeneously distributed on concentric spheres. Similarly, the $\mathrm{Cl^-}$ ion can act as a $-e$ point charge if the $+17 \ e$ charge of its nucleus and the $-18 \ e$ charge of its orbital electrons are distributed homogeneously on concentric spheres.

Further facts are that when the distance $l$ between the ions decreases below $2 l_0$, their attraction weakens, reaching zero at $l = l_0$, i.e., when the molecule is formed. If the ions are then forced to a distance smaller than $l_0$ (e.g., by outside pressure on the substance) they repel each other, and the repulsion steeply increases with decreasing distance. This behavior is depicted by the plots of the attractive and repulsive energies as functions of distance in Figure 1.

The repulsive interaction appears in addition to the electrostatic attraction when the distance between the ions is smaller than $2 l_0$. This means that while the electrostatic interaction has an infinite range, the repulsive interaction has a
range shorter than $2 l_0$. It is therefore named 'the short-range repulsion'. The attraction between the ions at $l = l_0$ being zero means that in the molecule the short-range repulsion and the electrostatic attraction forces are equal to each other and the total energy of the two interactions has a minimum. (See Figure 1.) Thus, the two interactions together provide the stability of the molecule.

<BindingEnergy>

$l_0$  is the equilibrium distance between the ions in the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ molecule or lattice, also between the electron and positron in the $e^- e^+$ pair or lattice. ${}_{es}E_0$ is the electrostatic attraction energy ${}_{es}E$ at $l = l_0$. ${}_{sr}E$ is the short-range repulsion energy, and ${}_tE$ is the total energy, attractive for $l > l_0$ and repulsive for $l < l_0$ ; at $l = l_0$, ${}_tE$ has a minimum value, which is the binding energy ${}_bE$. In the lattices, ${}_bE = 0.9 \ {}_{es}E$ (Sections 5.4, 5.6).


### 5.3 The short-range repulsion

The origin of the short-range repulsion cannot be electrostatic, because, as textbooks teach, electrostatic forces alone cannot keep a system of electrical charges in equilibrium. Such a system, whether in the form of a particle, atom, molecule or lattice, would either explode or collapse. Hence, the repulsion cannot be due, e.g., to charge displacements in the ions at proximity, which would expose the electrostatic repulsion between the filled electron shells of the two ions or between their bare nuclei. (Unfortunately, such explanations still persist in teaching.) The gravitational interaction between the $\mathrm{Na^+}$ and $\mathrm{Cl^-}$ ions is 30 orders of magnitude weaker than their electrostatic interaction, so that the short-range repulsion cannot be gravitational in nature. Neither can it be nuclear, because this fundamenlal interaction has a range of 1fm.

The only fundamental interaction left is the electromagnetic one, therefore, the short-range repulsion must be electromagnetic in nature. (Such were also found to be viscosity, adhesion, friction and lately, also the weak nuclear force).

The electromagnetic bUbutI non-electrostatic nature of the short-range repulsion can be explained by considering that each of the ions is a complicated system of many charged particles, which are involved in very fast spinning or also in fast orbiting on non-simple orbits, the planes of which rotate around axes which are vibrating or/and precessing. When the distance between the ions exceeds $2 l_0$ all the complicated motions remain an 'internal concern' in each of them and they balance, allowing the ion to appear to the outside world as an analytically treatable coulombic point-charge. At distances smaller than $2 l_0$, the orbiting electrons of each ion interact with the orbiting electrons of the other ion by involving their orbital magnetic moments and the spin magnetic moments. This electrodynamic interaction of mostly magnetic nature results in the short-range repulsion. With decreasing distance between the ions the repulsion strengthens; first, due to the growing interaction between their outermost orbiting electrons, then, due to the increasing number of outer orbiting electrons involved. Finally, inner shell orbiting electrons may be forced into the interaction, resulting in the steep growth of the repulsion at distances below $l_0$.


### 5.4 Formation and stability of the NaCl lattice

In the formation and stability of the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal lattice, the electrostatic attraction and the short-range repulsion between the $\mathrm{Na^+}$ and $\mathrm{Cl^-}$ ions play the same role as in the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ molecule. The only adjustment to the electroslatic energy is the introduction of the Madelung constant $\alpha$ to Coulomb's expression
for the electrostatic force ${}_{es}F_0$,

$$
\begin{align}
{}_{es}F_0 = \frac{k \alpha e^2}{{l_0}^2}
\end{align}
$$

and for the electrostatic energy ${}_{es}E_0$ of the ion,

$$
\begin{align}
{}_{es}E_0 = \frac{k \alpha e^2}{l_0}
\end{align}
$$

In $\mathrm{NaCl}$, $\alpha = 1.75$ (for $l$ close to $l_0$), meaning that the electrostatic energy of an ion, say $\mathrm{Na^+}$, in the lattice is 1.75 times larger than its energy would be at a distance $l_0$ from the other ion, say $\mathrm{Cl^-}$, when both were outside the lattice. In other alkali halides, Madelung's constant can differ by 0.5 percent.

An exact expression for the short-range repulsion cannot be given, because exact analytical solutions are possible for the dynamic interactions of only two point masses or two point charges. The short-range repulsion energy ${}_{sr}E$ was therefore approximated either by a power function of the type ${}_{sr}E = B \cdot l^{-n}$ (Lenard-Jones potentials, 1917) or by an exponential function of the type

$$
\begin{align}
{}_{sr}E = A \ exp \left( \frac{-l}{r} \right)
\end{align}
$$

Here, $A$ and $r$ (or $B$ and $n$) are factors, chosen to fit experimental data. These early approaches yield acceptable results without obscuring the physics (as do the mathematically advanced approaches, which, disappointingly enough, do not always fit experimental data any better). In the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ lattice, $r = 0.1 \ l_0$; in other alkali halides $r$ is in the range from $0.08$ to $0.14 \ l_0$.


### 5.5 The short-range repulsion in the epola

When introducing the epola, we made a daring assumption that this lattice is analogous in structure to the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal lattice. This means, particularly, that for the epola we may use the ${}_{es}E$ and ${}_{sr}E$ expressions, with the values of $\alpha$ and $r$ which fit the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ lattice. The use of the ${}_{es}E$ expression (Eq. 2) should not raise objections, because the epola lattice-constant $l_0$ is within the validity range of Coulomb's Law, and the charges ($-e$ and $+e$) are the same. Also, at distances above $2 \ l_0$ (or 10 fm), free electrons and positrons are known to interact as $-e$ and $+e$ point charges. Again, such behavior is possible only if the charges of the electron and of the positron are somehow homogeneously distributed over spherical surfaces in them.

As to the use of the ${}_{sr}E$ expression (equation 3), the very existence of a non-electrostatic short-range repulsion between electrons and positrons at distances below $2 \ l_0$ must be agreed upon, if a lattice built of these particles is to exist. As in $\mathrm{NaCl}$, the repulsion in the epola is still out of the range of nuclear forces and cannot be gravitational; therefore, it has to be electrodynamic, mostly magnetic in nature. In the epola, the explanation then is, that at distances below $2 \ l_0$ the complexity of the inner structure of electrons and positrons enters the play. The subparticles (quarks?) of each one of these particles begin to act on the subparticles of the other, affecting the moving charge distributions, their magnetic moments and spins, similar to what was described to occur in the $\mathrm{Na^+}$ and $\mathrm{Cl^-}$ ions. The $2 \ l_0$ range of the short-range repulsion in both lattices makes the calculation of the lattice constant with equations 2 and 3 independent of $A$ and insensitive to the specific small value chosen for $r$.


### 5.6 Calculation of the e<sup>&ndash;</sup>e<sup>+</sup> lattice constant

Adding (algebraically) the energy ${}_{sr}E$ of the short-range repulsion, given by equation 3, to the energy ${}_{es}E$ of the electrostatic attraction (with a minus sign for attraction) yields the total interaction energy ${}_t E$ per particle (or per ion pair in the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ lattice). The graphs of these energies as functions of the distance $l$ between the particles (or ions) in the lattice are shown in Figure 1. It is seen that at $l = l_0$ (here $l_0$ is the lattice constant) the total energy has a minimum value, which is the binding energy ${}_b E$ per particle (or per ion pair in the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ lattice). Therefore, at $l = l_0$ the resultant of the two interaction forces, $\left( \delta / \delta l \right) \ {}_{es}E + \left( \delta / \delta l \right) \ {}_{sr}E$ is zero. Hence,

$$
A = \left( \frac{r}{l_0} \right) \cdot exp \left( \frac{l_0}{r} \right) \cdot {}_{es}E_0
$$

In the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal, thus also in the epola, $r = 0.1 \ l_0$, so that $A = 2200 \ {}_{es}E_0$ and

$$
{}_{es}E_0 = -0.1 \ {}_{es}E_0
$$

Therefore,

$$
{}_b E = {}_{es}E_0 + {}_{sr}E_0 = 0.9 \ {}_{es}E_0 \ ,
$$

and

$$
l_0 = 0.9 \ \frac{k \alpha e^2}{{}_bE} \ .
$$

Substituting the epola binding energy ${}_bE = m_e c^2 = 0.511 \ \mathrm{MeV}$, we find $l_0 = 4.44 \ \mathrm{fm}$. This value is in fact, not sensitive to the specific *small* value chosen for $r$. The variation of $r$ from $0$ to $0.20 \ l_0$ (i.e., in a much wider range than that noted earlier for various alkali halides) results in values of $l_0$ between
$4.92 \ \mathrm{fm}$ and $3.94 \ \mathrm{fm}$. We therefore propose for $l_0$ the value

$$
l_0 = \left( 4.4 \pm 0.5 \right) \ \mathrm{fm} \ .
$$

### 5.7 The face-centered cubic lattice

The face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice of the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal and of the epola is shown in Figure 2. Here the corners of the elementary cubes, marked alternately black and white (for positive and negative occupation) are the 'lattice sites'. The distance between two nearest lattice sites is the 'lattice constant'. (The lines in the figure were drawn to ease presentation and do not exist in the epola or in crystals.)

The $e^-$ and $e^+$ particles of the epola or the $\mathrm{Na^+}$ and $\mathrm{Cl^-}$ ions of the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal are vibrating randomly in thermal vibrations around their lattice sites. In the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal the lattice structure and the lattice constant $l_0 = 280 \ \mathrm{pm}$ were revealed using X-ray diffraction techniques (Laue, 1912).

The lattice constant $l_0$ of the epola, calculated in Section 5.6, is $l_0 = \left( 4.4 \pm 0.5 \right) \ \mathrm{fm}$. Neutron diffraction techniques may become able to reveal the epola structure when (and if) resolutions of $1 \ \mathrm{fm}$ are reached. Until then, we shall hold on to the analogy with the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystal lattice, which enables the calculations of the epola structure.
