# Chapter 12. Interactions Carried by the Epola

</div>


### 12.1 The epola deformation around a neutral guest particle

Consider an electrically neutral guest particle of mass $m$ (e.g., a neutron).
located centrally in a unit cube of the epola, as shown in Figure 6. The distance
from the center of the particle to each of the 8 nearest lattice points is $0.87 \ l_0$,
where $l_0$ is the epola lattice constant, $l_0 = (4.4 \pm 0.5) \ \mathrm{fm}$. On such a distance, the
repulsive action of the guest particle is very strong, so that the 4 electrons and
the 4 positrons are pushed (equally) far out of these lattice points. The second
group of 24 lattice sites is at a distance of $1.66 \ l_0$ from the center of the guest
particle. At such distance, the direct repulsive action of the guest particle is
weak. It pushes (equally) the 12 electrons and the 12 positrons slightly out of
their lattice sites. The third group of lattice points is at a distance of $2.18 \ l_0$, out
of the range of the direct repulsion by the guest particle.

Each of the outwardly displaced 8 epola particles of the first group pushes
strongly outward its three nearest neighbors of the second group of 24 particles,
which are also repelled by the guest particle. The 8 particles of the first group
also push, though much weaker, the particles of the third group. The 24 particles
of the second group push strongly outward the particles of the third group,
which are also repelled by the particles of the second group, and so on.

Our first qualitative conclusion is that though the range of the direct
repulsion by the guest particle, as well as by each of the involved and displaced
epola particles, is limited to $2 \ l_0$, the deformation of the epola continues ad
infinitum or up to some boundary in the epola; and, although the deformation is
caused by a neutral particle and by the non-electrostatic repulsion, the
spreading of the deformation, as well as the actual positioning of the displaced
epola particles (more exactly &ndash; of their equilibrium points in random vibrations)
are influenced by the electrostatic interaction between these particles.

Shadowed arrows show displacements of 8 nearest epola particles. The repulsion by the electron
marked 1 and by the positron marked 2 of the three nearest neighbors of each is shown by short
arrows. The six particles belong to the second group of 24 particles, which also sustain the direct
repulsion by the guest particle.


### 12.2 The gravitational interaction

Let us now consider the interaction between two neutral guest particles of
mass $m_1$ and $m_2$ (e.g., two neutrons). The distance $l_{12}$ between them is large
enough (e.g., $l_{12} > 1000 \ l_0$), so that the epola volume around each guest particle,
deformed by the repulsion of this particle, is spherically symmetric. This is
presented in Figure 7. It is seen that in the epola region behind the first particle,
the repulsion of the epola by this particle is strengthened due to the repulsive
action on the epola of the second particle. Similarly, in the epola region behind
the second particle, the repulsion of the epola by this particle is strengthened,
due to the repulsive action on the epola of the first particle. However. in the
region between the two guest particles, the repulsion of the epola by one particle
is weakened by the repulsion due to the other particle. Hence,
the epola deformation *behind* each guest particle is stronger than in the
region between the two particles; therefore, the unevenly-deformed epola
reacts by pushing the two guest particle toward each other; this results in
an attractive interaction between them.

It is clear from our qualitative analysis that the forces and the energy of this
interaction must increase with the increase of each of the masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, and
must decrease with the increase of the distance between the particles. We
therefore identify this interaction as the gravitational interaction between the
particles. It is easy to extend this physical model to the case of the gravitational
interaction between conglomerates of particles, i.e., bodies of nuclear matter,
atoms and bodies of atom. The model allows us to derive Newton's Law of
gravitation with the help of basic calculus, and to approach a calculation of the
gravitational constant.

Light arrows 1 and 2 show the repulsion of 6 distant epola particles, caused by the neutral guest
particles $m_1$ and $m_2$. The resultant repulsions are marked $R$. Behind each guest particle $R$'s' are
increased by the repulsion of the other guest particle, while in the region between them, $R$'s are
reduced. Heavy arrows show gravitational forces by which the unevenly deformed epola reacts,
pusbing $m_1$ and $m_2$ toward each other.


### 12.3 The epola as carrier of the gravitational interaction

In Sections 5.3 and 5.5, we have seen that the short-range repulsion is a
derivative of the electromagnetic interaction (as are, e.g., adhesion, viscosity
and friction). Now, we find that gravitation is due to differences in the
short-range repulsion-field in the epola. This agrees with the striking weakness
of the gravitational interaction, compared with the known fundamental
interactions, nuclear and electromagnetic, which are 39 and 37 orders of
magnitude stronger. And, because the gravitational interaction is derived from
the short-range repulsion, we must conclude tbat gravitation is not a fundamental
interaction, but is of electromagnetic origin. Therefore, all physical
phenomena outside the nuclei are governed by one only fundamental interaction &ndash; 
the electromagnetic interaction.

Being the carrier of the gravitational interaction, the epola is also the carrier
of the gravitational field. Therefore, the gravitational constant is not universal
but is a parameter, depending on the conditions in the epola. These are, mainly,
the epola temperature and imperfections (Sections 11.3, 11.4). Regions where
the epola is molten or evaporated or just highly-distorted (different kinds of
black holes) most strikingly disobey our "universal" laws and constants.

It also follows from our model that there are no separate quasi-particles of
energy-transfer in the gravitational field, or gravitons, meant to be photon-analogs.
The gravitational field is a "subsidiary" of the electromagnetic field,
quite inferior to the main constituents &ndash; the electrostatic and the magnetic fields,
all sharing the epola as their carrier. Any changes in The electrostatic or the
magnetic fields are known to cause in the epola electromagnetic waves with their
photons. Similarly, then, any changes in the gravitational field, e.g., mass
reduction processes (explosions) and mass production (collapses in the epola)
cause electromagnetic waves with their photons. Even the slightest redistribution
of masses or motion of particles cause in the epola electromagnetic
accompanying waves, with the corresponding de Broglie wavelengths and
photons. Thus, there is no function left for separate quasi-particles of the
gravitational field, just as there is no need for separate quasi-particles of the
electrostatic or magnetic fields.


### 12.4 Epola deformation around a resting free electron and the electrostatic interaction

Let us consider a resting free electron positioned in the center of an epola
unit cube, as in Figure 6. Because of the short-range repulsion, the guest
electron pushes the nearest four epola electrons and four positrons equally out
of the corners of the unit cube. The guest electron also equally repels the 12
electrons and 12 positrons of the second group of epola particles, as described in
Section 12.1. Hence, the deformation in the epola around the guest electron,
forced by the short-range repulsion, is identical to the deformation caused by a
neutral particle of equal mass. We have seen in Section 12.2 that such epola
distortions around two distant neutral particles result in their gravitational
interaction. Hence. the gravitational action of electrons, as well as of any
charged dense particles, is identical to the gravitational action of neutral
particles of equal mass.

The electrostatic action of the guest electron at a distance of $0.87 \ l_0$, where
the eight corner particles are, is much weaker than its repulsive action (Section
5.6). Therefore, the electron pushes the four corner electrons slightly farther
out than it follows from the short-range repulsion. The four corner positrons,
attracted to the guest electron, are pushed out of their lattice sites slightly less,
owing to the short-range repulsion. The second group of 24 lattice sites is at
a distance of $1.66 \ l_0$, at which the short-range repulsion is much weaker than the
direct electrostatic action of the guest electron. The third group of lattice points
is at a distance of $2.18 \ l_0$, completely out of range of the short-range repulsion
but under its strong electrostatic action, which pulls the positrons nearer in and
pushes the electrons farther out. Hence, an electrostatic deformation of the
epola around the guest electron is superimposed on the gravitational distortion.

It can be shown that at a distance from the guest electron, where spherical
symmetry can be assumed, the electrostatic deformation in the epola forms
spherical double-layers of charge, with the positive charge of epola positrons
displaced toward the common center of the spheres. and with the negative
charge of epola electrons, moved outward. Hence, a deviation from charge
neutrality is caused in the epola on the surface of each sphere. We can calculate
this deviation and show that

> the deviation from charge neutrality in the epola on the surface of any
sphere, centered around a charged dense guest particle, which is at rest in the
epola, is such as if there were a charge, distributed homogeneously on the
surface of the sphere and equal to the charge of the guest particle.

A similar result is obtained in classical electrostatics when the Coulomb and
Gauss laws are applied to treat the electric field in a dielectric medium. We got
our results from epola considerations alone, without using these laws. Therefore,
we may proceed the other way around and derive the laws of electrostatics,
just for an additional affirmation of the epola model.


### 12.5 On magnetic interaction and spin

The magnetic interaction is the most complex among the interactions studied
in physics and there is not much the epola model can add towards its
understanding on the elementary level developed here. We may divide the
magnetic forces into three groups: magnetism of dense particles and their
subparticles, including spin; magnetism of atoms and atomic bodies, and the
magnetism of electric currents.

The magnetism of dense particles belongs to the fundamental properties of
the particles and is not in the domain of the epola model, as also is not the nature
of electric charge or nuclear properties. We can only remark that the epola
model does allow the original interpretation of the magnetic spin of particles.
The magnetic spin-moment of the electron was discovered in 1925 by Goudsmit
and Uhlenbeck and explained as due to the rotation of the electron around its
axis. This is reflected in the given name 'spin'. The charge of the electron was
considered as homogeneously spread over the outer surface of the electron
(Section 5.8). The rotation of such charge represents circular currents, the
magnetic moment of which would be that of the spin. However, calculation with
the assumed 2.8 fm electromagnetic radius of the electron showed that, in order
to yield the known value of the spin, the electron would have to rotate so fast
that the velocities of its equatorial points would exceed the velocity of light.
Hence, this physical model contradicted relativity and was abandoned, leaving
us with its name only.

In the epola model, the lumic velocity limit is not absolute and superlumic
motion of dense particles is possible (Sections 8.14-8.16). The radius of the
electron is also argumented to be quite smaller than 2.8 fm (Section 5.10). Such
a guest electron inside an epola unit cube deforms the epola, as discussed in
Section 12.4. It is also possible that there is an additional adjustment of the spins
(if any) of the neighboring epola particles to the spin of the guest electron.
Except for this single adjustment, the spinning of the guest electron with any
rotational velocity would not raise an epola resistance, as does sublumic or
superlumic translational motion. Hence, a real spinning of dense particles is
allowed in the epola model. Whether or not dense particles do really spin or
what else might be the physical nature of the magnetic spin relates to the
fundamental properties of these particles and is not for the epola model to
decide.

The magnetism of atoms and atomic matter is composed of the magnetism of
their constituent dense particles and of the magnetism of the electric currents,
resulting from the motions of these particles inside the atoms and between them.
A microscopic epola analysis of the magnetic interactions here would add more
complexities than understanding. We can see it even on the simplest case of the
magnetic interaction between two straight and parallel direct electric currents.


### 12.6 Magnetic interaction of straight currents

The simple experimental fact is that two parallel straight currents attract
each other, and antiparallel currents repel each other. This is treated in physics
by depicting the magnetic fields with lines of force. The lines of force in the
magnetic field of a straight electric current are shown to be concentric circles,
centered on the long axis of the current (or of the current-carrying wire) and
directed, as shown in Figure 8. A rule is also introduced, stating that:

> a current (or current-carrying wire) is pushed in an external magnetic field
away from where the magnetic field of the current strengthens the external
field, towards the region where it weakens the external field; or, from
where the lines of force of the two fields have similar directions to where
they oppose each other.

<MagneticLines>
*Figure 8. Magnetic lines of force of straight parallel electric currents and their interaction.*
*Eyelets represent cross-sections of currents directed towards the reader; arrows on the circular lines
of force show their direction (action on north-point of magnetic needle); heavy arrows show forces
on currents due to the interaction.*
</MagneticLines>

It is seen in Figure 8 that *behind* each of the two parallel currents, the
magnetic field is strengthened by the magnetic field of the other current.
*Between* the two parallel currents, the field of one current weakens the field of
the other. Hence, the currents are pushed towards each other. An opposite
situation occurs in the case of two antiparallel currents.

The above rule is applicable in all cases of the ponderomotive action of
magnetic fields on currents or of the magnetic interaction of currents and can
replace all mnemonical rules; it can even be adjusted to yield the direction of
electromagnetically induced currents. It works so well that it is accepted as an
explanation, though it actually does not explain the physics of the interaction.

A full epola explanation of the magnetic interaction of currents should take
into account the following factors: 1.) The displacements of epola particles and
the epola deformation caused by the applied electric fields (voltages), which
propel the currents. 2.) The effect of these deformations on the accompanying
waves of the charged dense particles in the motion of charge carriers (holes,
alpha-particles, ions), which carry the current or participate in it, along with free
(or "free") electrons, or without them. 3.) The effect of the moving dense
particles of the charge carriers on the displacements of epola particles displaced
by the applied fields.

Clearly, even in the case of straight currents, the analysis would yield more
complexities than understanding. We may reach some understanding when the
current is carried by charge-carriers of one polarity, e.g., by electrons. Then we
have good reasons to assume, on top of all mentioned complexities, that the
moving electrons pull the epola positrons slightly toward their flow, and push
the epola electrons slightly away; this action is the stronger, the closer to the
current. Therefore, the deformation of the surrounding epola can be presented
by cylindrical surfaces, coaxial with the current, as shown in Figure 9. On the
insides of the surfaces, there are slightly more epala positrons, and on the
outsides &ndash; slightly more electrons. If a similar electron-current is placed parallel
to the first one, then, as is seen in Figure 9, in the region between the two
currents, their cylindrical surfaces face each other with similar charges. The
repulsion of these charges acts against the epola deformation, reducing it.
Behind each current. the cylindrical surfaces face each other with opposite
charges. Their attraction increases the displacements of the epola particles and
the deformation of the epola. Therefore, the deforming action of the two
parallel currents on the epola is stronger behind the currents than between
them. Hence, the reaction of the epola, acting on the currents, is stronger
behind the currents than between them. An opposite result can easily be
obtained in the case of anti-parallel currents. As a result, the unevenly deformed
epola pushes the parallel currents towards each other anti pulls antiparallel
currents away from each other. Thus, we obtained a rough explanation of the
facts and rules of Section 12.5.

Light arrows show the flow of electrons (opposite to the agreed direction of currents); the $+$ and $-$
represent charges due to the displacements of epola particles; between the currents, the repulsion of
the negative charges on the outer sides of surfaces marked 1 and 2 reduce the displacements and the
epola deformation; behind each current, surfaces 1 and 2 face each other with opposite charges;
their attraction increases the displacements and the epola deformation; heavy arrow show forces
with which the deformed epola acts on the currents.


### 12.7 Comparison of electrostatic, magnetic and gravitational interactions

The cylindric double-layer surfaces around the straight current, representing
the epola deformation by the current, differ from the spherical double-layer
surfaces around the guest electron or other charged particle (Section 12.4).
These spheres have on their outer sides, compared to the charge on their insides,
an excess charge, equal to the charge of the guest particle. Hence, the epola
around a charged guest particle is electrically charged and induces electrical
charges on atomic bodies. In the 'vacuum' or 'field' language, one says that the
electric field around a charge induces static electrical charges on atomic bodies.

The electric charges on the insides and outsides of the cylindric surfaces
around the straight current are equal to each other; hence, except for small
electric dipole moments on the lattice-unit level, the deformed epola around the
straight current is electrically neutral or, in the 'field' language, the magnetic
field is electrically neutral and does not induce static electric charges in atomic
bodies. Similarly neutral is also the gravitationally distorted epola around a
neutral dense particle (Section 12.1) or, in the field language, the gravitational
field is electrically neutral.

The strengths of the three interactions are usually compared on the
interactions between two protons, held at a certain distance. Then, the
electrostatic interaction between them is the strongest. Their magnetic interaction,
calculated with the known values of their spin magnetic moments, is a
hundred times weaker. However, the gravitational interaction forces and
energy between two protons are 37 orders of magnitude smaller than in their
electrostatic interaction. The weakness of the gravitational interaction is
explained in the epola model by it being a derivative of the short-range
interaction, directly acting only from point-to-point and from point-to-next-nearest
point (Section 12.1). The electrostatic and magnetic interactions, too,
can be understood as point-to-point interactions, but they also have a direct
range which far exceeds the epola lattice constant.

The electrostatic interaction between two charged particles is due to their
action on one another, supported and carried by the epola. However, both the
magnetic interaction of currents and the gravitational interaction of neutral
particles are due to the action on them of the epola, in response of its
deformation by them. Hence, we may say that where there is no epola, as, e.g.,
in black holes (Section 11.5), there is no gravitation, no magnetic interaction of
currents, thus, no electromagnetic radiation, no photons. The presence or
absence of electrostatic interaction there, could be clarified if it were possible
to observe a stream of charged particles entering such a black hole. Because of
the absence of magnetic attraction in the black hole, the streams would not be
held together by the magnetic attraction of parallel currents. Therefore, if the
stream were to dissipate as a disbanded sheaf, then this would have occured
due to the presence of an electrostatic repulsion between the charged
particles. If the bundle were to keep its form, then this
would mean that there is no electrostatic interaction in the black hole and that
the electrostatic interaction too is possible only in the epola.
