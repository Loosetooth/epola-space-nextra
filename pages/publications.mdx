**THE ELECTRON- POSITRON LATTICE (EPOLA) MODEL OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD**

**Contributions by M. Simhony**

1. **The  Electron  Positron  Lattice;**  30  page  article,  Submitted  to  the *Physical Review D* in March 1973. Abstract published in the *Bulletin of the American Physical Society,* Volume 18, Dec.1973, p.1579. In short notation: Bull. APS 18 (1973) 1959.

This and tens of other related articles were rejected by "leading" physics journals,  all  without  pointing  out  a  single  mistake,  just  by  saying "contradicts accepted scientific knowledge", "is too speculative", "does not fit the scope of the journal", and similar suppressive "shut up" non-scientific reasons.

The policy of rejecting everything which contradicts accepted theories, especially relativity and quantum theory, was started in the 1930ies, after the 150 years long "freedom  of publication" era  in physics. During this  era, papers, in which referees could not find mistakes, were published, no matter whether  and  how  much  they  contradicted  the  "accepted  scientific knowledge". Therefore, the highly controversial papers of Max Planck on quanta (1900) and of Albert Einstein on relativity (1905) were published, not rejected. It seems that Einstein initiated the rejection policy, by turning down (in  1919)  Kaluza's  paper  on  a  five-  dimensional  space-time,  because  it contradicted Einstein's four- dimensional system.

Rejection of the papers on the epola structure of space does not mean that the  epola  model  is  wrong,  and  should  not  even  be  considered  as  an indication  of  it  being  wrong.  Most  of  the  Contributions  listed  are presentations at scientific meetings and conferences, in which the rightness of the epola considerations were checked.
